@attribute review {'It has no side effect, I take it in combination of Bystolic 5 Mg and Fish Oil','I used to take another oral contraceptive, which had 21 pill cycle, and was very happy- very light periods, max 5 days, no other side effects. But it contained hormone gestodene, which is not available in US, so I switched to Lybrel, because the ingredients are similar. When my other pills ended, I started Lybrel immediately, on my first day of period, as the instructions said. And the period lasted for two weeks. When taking the second pack- same two weeks. And now, with third pack things got even worse- my third period lasted for two weeks and now it&039;s the end of the third week- I still have daily brown discharge. The positive side is that I didn&039;t have any other side effects. The idea of being period free was so tempting... Alas.','This is my first time using any form of birth control. I&039;m glad I went with the patch, I have been on it for 8 months. At first It decreased my libido but that subsided. The only downside is that it made my periods longer (5-6 days to be exact) I used to only have periods for 3-4 days max also made my cramps intense for the first two days of my period, I never had cramps before using birth control. Other than that in happy with the patch','Suboxone has completely turned my life around.  I feel healthier, I&039;m excelling at my job and I always have money in my pocket and my savings account.  I had none of those before Suboxone and spent years abusing oxycontin.  My paycheck was already spent by the time I got it and I started resorting to scheming and stealing to fund my addiction.  All that is history.  If you&039;re ready to stop, there&039;s a good chance that suboxone will put you on the path of great life again.  I have found the side-effects to be minimal compared to oxycontin.  I&039;m actually sleeping better.   Slight constipation is about it for me.  It truly is amazing. The cost pales in comparison to what I spent on oxycontin.','2nd day on 5mg started to work with rock hard erections however experianced headache, lower bowel preassure. 3rd day erections would wake me up &amp; hurt Leg/ankles aches   severe lower bowel preassure like you need to go 2 but can&039;t Enjoyed the initial rockhard erections but not at these side effects or $230 for months supply I&039;m 50 &amp; work out 3Xs a week. Not worth side effects','He pulled out, but he cummed a bit in me. I took the Plan B 26 hours later, and took a pregnancy test two weeks later - - I&039;m pregnant.','I have been taking this medicine due to lower back trouble.  When I first took it, it worked great, now all it does is put me to sleep.','Decreased my sex drive and physically in a lot more pain in my joints... It&039;s good for women over 25 but under 25 is not the best','Abilify changed my life. There is hope. I was on Zoloft and Clonidine when I first started Abilify at the age of 15.. Zoloft for depression and Clondine to manage my complete rage. My moods were out of control. I was depressed and hopeless one second and then mean, irrational, and full of rage the next. My Dr. prescribed me 2mg of Abilify and from that point on I feel like I have been cured though I know I&039;m not.. Bi-polar disorder is a constant battle. I know Abilify works for me because I have tried to get off it and lost complete control over my emotions. Went back on it and I was golden again.  I am on 5mg 2x daily. I am now 21 and better than I have ever been in the past. Only side effect is I like to eat a lot.',' I Ve had  nothing but problems with the Keppera : constant shaking in my arms &amp; legs &amp; pins &amp; needles feeling in my arms &amp; legs severe light headedness no appetite &amp; etc.','I had been on the pill for many years. When my doctor changed my RX to chateal, it was as effective. It really did help me by completely clearing my acne, this takes about 6 months though. I did not gain extra weight, or develop any emotional health issues. I stopped taking it bc I started using a more natural method of birth control, but started to take it bc I hate that my acne came back at age 28. I really hope symptoms like depression, or weight gain do not begin to affect me as I am older now. I&039;m also naturally moody, so this may worsen things. I was in a negative mental rut today. Also I hope this doesn&039;t push me over the edge, as I believe I am depressed. Hopefully it&039;ll be just like when I was younger.','I have been on this medication almost two weeks, started out on 25mg and working my way up to 100mg, currently at 50mg. No headaches at all so far and I was having 2-3 crippling migraines a week. I have lost 5.2lbs so far but note I am really paying close attention to what I am eating, I have a lot of weight to lose and if weight loss is a side effect I want to help it along as much as I can.  Now, other side effects, they are there the word recall issues exist, the memory issues, the worst of it seems to be the vision disturbances, there have been times I have just not driven because I&039;m sure it would not have been safe. The good news is it seems to be wearing off...I have tons of energy and I am in a great mood.','I have taken anti-depressants for years, with some improvement but mostly moderate to severe side affects, which makes me go off them.  I only take Cymbalta now mostly for pain.  When I began Deplin, I noticed a major improvement overnight. More energy, better disposition, and no sinking to the low lows of major depression. I have been taking it for about 3 months now and feel like a normal person for the first time ever. Best thing, no side effects.','I had Crohn&039;s with a resection 30 years ago and have been mostly in remission since.  Have recently had a bad flare and narrowing at the anastomosis and need to be on medication, but haven&039;t found one that I can handle.  Asacol gave me such serious body aching and fatigue that I could not function.  Pentasa immediately gave me heart palpitations and arrhythmias so I had to discontinue it.','Really did the trick for my migraine with no side effects.  Tastes terrible but I&039;ll take that over a migraine any day','Worked wonders for my poison ivy rash. Quick relief and healing when all others failed','Much needed co-analgesic prescription for chronic pain.','Have a little bit of a lingering cough from a cold. Not giving me much trouble except keeps me up at night. I heard this was good so I took so I could get some sleep. Helped tremendously with the cough but then I was having bad stomach cramps and diarrhea. I hadn&039;t eaten anything that should have upset my stomach and it didn&039;t really feel like a &quot;bug&quot; so I looked up side effects for Delsym.  Now I wish I had done that first because I probably wouldn&039;t have taken it. So, while it worked for my cough I still didn&039;t get any sleep due to the stomach issues.','Started Nexplanon 2 months ago because I have a minimal amount of contraception&039;s I can take due to my inability to take the hormone that is used in most birth controls. I&039;m trying to give it time because it is one of my only options right now. But honestly if I had options I&039;d get it removed. I&039;ve never had acne problems in my life, and immediately broke out after getting it implanted. Sex drive is completely gone, and I used to have sex with my boyfriend a few days a week, now its completely forced and not even fun for me anymore. I mean I&039;m on birth control because I like having sex but don&039;t want to get pregnant, why take a birth control that takes away sex? Very unhappy and hope that I get it back with time or I&039;m getting it removed.','I have been taking Saxenda since July 2016.  I had severe nausea for about a month once I got up to the 2.6 dosage.  It has since subsided and the only side effect I notice now is the dry mouth.  I make sure to drink  2.5 litres of water a day (about 10 glasses).  This helps with the weight loss as well as the constipation.  I have been reducing my dose to find a comfortable spot where I am still losing weight but don&039;t feel like I am over medicating.  For me, 1.8 is working very well.  I also feel wearing a Fitbit has really helped.  I can track my food, water, exercise and steps - it keeps me moving more.  When this started I could barely walk the length of myself without getting winded - I have lost 58 lbs so far.','This drug worked very well for me and cleared up my UTI in a matter of 48hrs, although I was on a 7 day course of 2x200mg/daily. Unfortunately once the tablets finished the infection returned so needed a 2nd course. I&039;m currently taking a low dose at evening to keep the infection at bay while the specialists do some tests.  I normally get every side effect going and dread taking new medication in any form especially after an horrific experience with Ciorofloxacin but the only side effect I experienced with this was itchy ankles and feet on day two but that didn&039;t last into third day so I would class this as a minor side effect and insignificant. Good luck.','I&039;ve been taking amitriptyline since January 2013 after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I tried cymbalta for a week and my Dr decided that since it kept me awake 24/7 that it wasn&039;t a good fit for me even though it relieved my pain. I started with 25 mg. After 2 weeks I had some breakthrough pain, so my Dr increased my dosage to 50mg and I&039;m still on that dosage today. For the first full year I was on this I never had pain and felt &039;cured&039;. As time went on, it seems to help control my pain. I do still have pain, but at a low manageable level. I take this around 7pm each evening to avoid feeling overly drowsy in the mornings. This med allows me to have a fairly normal life.','This medicine is horrible. I last 2 days on only 25 mgs. The side effects are not worth it.','This gel is so effective that I don&039;t need to take ibuprofen anymore. Very soothing, quick acting, long lasting, pleasant smell that soon dissipates.','I&039;ve been on every medicine under the sun (it seems) to manage the hypomania / mania of Bipolar2. Within a few days of starting Lamictal (was on Tegretol) it was as if someone had turned a light on in my head. Is this the way &quot;normal&quot; people think? was one of the first things that struck me. I sleep like a log, have no irritability, almost no anger (other than what would be considered normal). I am able to focus and my creative, impulsive thoughts have decreased enough to be manageable. It&039;s a God send as I would perennially be in a state of hypo mania, which sounds great, but I was physically and emotionally exhausted. My libido is markedly lower but I wonder if that is perhaps an effect of not being hypo manic. I take 20 mg for anxiety.','I have been on Tasigna for just over 3 years now (300mg x 2 times a day) Tasigna worked for me within a few weeks I have been in remission for basically the entire 3 years. As for the side effects, I feel sick to my stomach, tired,  severe leg and arm pain, I can&039;t walk to long without needing a break, I went from working full time to not working at all because I am so tired all the time.... but hey I am in remission and alive so is all the above really a problem? Nope','Spring of 2008 I was hospitalized with pnuemonia and diagnosed with Lyme diease and full blown AIDS with CD4 count of &quot;11&quot; viral load some number so high in the millions I could never remember. I was taking Combivir and Kaletra with Dapsone for the 1st year then it stopped working. I started Kaletra with the Dapsone my CD4 count is now 209 and rising. For a few weeks I was very aggressive and broke all my dishes in the house LOL. I take vitamin supplements and drink a boost pluz every day. LIfe is good now','I have insomnia, it&039;s horrible. My story begins with my PCP prescribing me Prozac to help with intestinal issues, because I was desperate I tried it, I was on it for 3 weeks. Stopped because of insomnia. Then I was prescribed Ativan, it out me out, but was very addicting. I had rebound insomnia. Then after about 14 days I hardly any sleep l tried the doctor one more time. I asked him about Trazadone. He told me that was a good medication for insomnia. He put me on 25 mgs, but stated I may have to figure out what dosage is best for me. I am currently taking 100 mgs, which is on the low range of what is prescribed, 400 mgs being at the high end for insomnia. I have the dry mouth and nasel congestion. I can live with that, I sleep now, yeah...','Nexplanon does its job. I can have worry free sex. The only thing is that my periods are sometimes light and sometimes heavy. Sometimes they go away and sometimes they show up unexpected. I also feel somewhat depressed. Not sure if its Nexplanon or not. I&039;ve had Nexplanont for about 2 months now, but despite the side effects its the most effective birth control I&039;ve ever used and I do not plan on taking it out.','I live in Western Australia and disturbed by some comments on here. The cost of Embrel is cost of an ordinary prescription $36 for me the government pays the remainder of the cost to the chemist. I also go to the the medical centre every Saturday morning a Dr looks over my prescription and then he advises the nurse to administer the injection also no cost to myself and this is part of nurses duties. I am unsure of the country where people who have made comments referring to cost and that nobody is there to  administer the injection for them. I am very lucky to live in Australia as we have the best health system worldwide and everybody is  given the opportunity to receive proper medical help whether you are rich or poor there is no discrimination.','Do not use the cream that comes with this. It turned my hoo-ha into a burning ring of fire. It is 1 am and I have to work tomorrow. It&039;s going to be a sleepless night for me','Was prescribed one dose over the course of one day, took 4 pills of 250mg after a light lunch, and had nausea and mild stomach pains/upset. Lying down did not alleviate the discomfort and threw up 3 hours later. Called up my doctor to check if I needed to take another dose but he said my body would have absorbed the pills by then. Still experiencing mild stomach pains but nausea is mostly gone now.','I&039;m writing a second review on Vaniqa.  I started using this in February this year. Twice a day although some days/times I do forget. I just want to say how delighted I am to have found this. It has totally and completely changed my life I had terrible male pattern hair growth all over my cheeks, chin, upper and lower lip and starting to grow down my neck. I used to pluck for up to 2 hrs a time every 3rd day but was never hair free. I wouldn&039;t kiss anyone hello or goodbye as even plucked the stubble could be felt under my skin. 3 months on im not scared of being caught in bright sunlight I pluck around once a fortnight and it takes around 10 mins. The hairs that are coming through are soft and downy. My life is transformed.','Hi all, My son who is 12 was diagnosed when he was in 2nd grade. We tried everything before medication. When we tried meds, the first one made him loose weight, fast. The second gave him a nasty tic that thankfully went away as soon as he stopped the med, the third worked for a couple of years and around January of last year we started to have problems so his doctor recommended Daytrana. It has been wonderful for my son Easy to use, he handles this for himself each day and takes it off when he gets home from school. The patch effects last long enough for him to do his homework. He does have issues with weight gain and sleep but he uses melatonin before bed if he feels like he will not be able to shut down. The shortage is KILLING us','Honestly, I have been taking ativan for 2 years now 1mg twice daily.  It does help but it should be used as a tool for panic attacks NOT A SOLUTION.  I have tried so many anti-depressants as well such as cymbalta, cipralex and a couple more.  The best thing is to talk to close friends and family or even a psychiatrist.  talking to people and venting is honestly the best thing you can do for yourself even though it takes a lot of will power to do it.  I would love to hear other people opinion.','At first I suffered through them. This included splitting head pain, nausea, and vomiting. I started using Excedrin after a while which helped if I took it right away. Then that started to not work so well anymore. I had one really bad one that lasted hours. I was still throwing up at 9 pm and I was now throwing up blood. I went to the ER and when I finally got in they put me on an IV to hydrate me. They then added Imitrex to the bag and I soon started feeling side effects. My head felt like I was going to pass out. My breathing became labored and it felt like someone was sitting on my chest. They said that meant it was working. After about two minutes everything was gone. I got pills to take at home and they worked okay. Not as fast.','1 week on Zoloft for anxiety and mood swings. I take 50mg in the mornings with my breakfast. Nausea on day one  but that subsided as the week went on.  I get the jitters about 2 hrs after taking it followed by yawning. I feel much better though and less angry/stressed.','I am 30 years old. I had a multiple composite spinal injuries 15 years ago. The aches and pains unbearable. I started taking anti-inflammatories about 2 years ago. I started getting injections every month of Toradol and &quot;Depo&quot; something. I am almost off all pain meds I mean I still have bad days but I can function again.','The burning is out of control about 20 minutes after inserting it . Sat in the bath trying to get this stuff out . This is awful','Have been taking Viberzi for a month now for IBS-D and I can&039;t be happier. I have ZERO side effects. Thank you for making me normal again','Reduced my pain by 80\% and lets me live a normal life again','SO MUCH PAIN  In the last 2 years I have suffered with a brain tumour so have been in a LOT of pain to the point of morphine everyday for a year. Then I had brain surgery...but the pain from this pill came pretty close In serious pain to the point of blacking out hot and cold shivers and just sat in pain feeling like trapped wind/indigestion it&039;s just.. Ahhhh Don&039;t take this','I have been on morphine for at least 7 years..It is the only medicine that seems to manage my pain. Without it I would be in bed 90\% of the time. With it I can have a life.','I have taken this at least 5-6 times for the last 10 years. I have had major problems with it since the first time. Causing me MAJOR FATIGUE. The last time I took it was 3 year&039;s ago and I had very severe cramps and not having enough time to get to the bathroom. I went to the hospital and the doctor said it didn&039;t work good enough so he had me go home and do a second round. I went back the next day and did the process with no energy. I had to do it last night and it was even worse than the other times. I was gagging it down and up all night with severe cramps. I tried the second dose in the morning and I just about started throwing up so I called the office and they said to stop. Once the doctor was done he said it didn&039;t evacuate enough','I had a similar experience.  Tremors in hands (not really noticeable to someone watching unless they were looking for it), but relief from the delusions I was experiencing. My problem has been going on for over 16 years so I anticipate it will not magically disappear (and it didn&039;t) but the clarity of thinking I experience with this medicine really helps me.','I am very prone to yeast infections, I believe it&039;s due to my birth control as well as having unprotected sex. Fluconazole has always cleared up my yeast infections with 2 doses. No side effects.','I am just finishing my second week taking Contrave and have lost 10 lbs. It has been an interesting experience because the drug is definitely not an appetite suppressant, yet it does help you control the urge to eat. I have had mild side effects - some stomach discomfort and slight headaches along with constipation, but it has all been easily manageable. If you are considering taking this medication please keep in mind that you still need to do the work by exercising and eating right, but the medication really does help. It has helped me get my motivation back to exercise, and it definitely helps with cravings to eat making it easy to just eat what I need to be healthy. Use the coupon they give you, it drops cost to $70','This medication changed my life.  My panic attacks were so out of control I was barely able to leave the house.  Within 2 days, a moderate does of this changed me into a new person.  That was 15 years ago.  My dosage has never changed.','my gp started me on Venlafaxine yesterday to help with depression and the change,a hour after taking them i was feeling very sick couldn,t stomach food or fluids, thought keep it up as she told me they did come with some side effects which would get better,took another one last night and was so ill i couldn,t stand ,being sick sweating shaking thought i was going to pass out. Did get some sleep hopeing to feel better this morning,took another one and felt so spaced out dry mouth shaking ,sick, so booked in to see gp again to make sure i should be feeling like this, only to find out she had put me on the wrong dose should have been on 37.5mg was put on 150mg, now on right dose hope this will be better','At initial testing my VL was over 6 million. I received my meds on saturday 2 days prior to testing to establish a baseline. I started when I received my pills. 2 days and 5 hours later I got my blood test to establish VL, I had taken 3 pills at this point and my VL was under 700.  VL @ 4 weeks was 0 . VL @ 8 weeks was 0 and @ 12 weeks was 0 .  2 weeks til my 1st EOT test. I feel cured. My side effects were next to nothing.','Side effects are light- fatigue and a bit of a headache. I did find it easier to take it an hour after dinner.  WAY better then the triple-threat approach.  My blood work does indicate that I am in the beggining stages of cirrhosis. I also had Hep B in 1994.   So far, it&039;s like a miracle.  Other than the fatigue (which is nothing if you&039;ve suffered Jaundice or the &039;Sickie&039; symptoms that Hep C can cause), it&039;s business as usual.','Helps against sadness, and strongly counters moderate urges to drink at a stressful, confusing time in my life.','24 Year Old, Male, UK ,Normally I would go every hour, even when drinking very small amounts of water or drinks.  I took this medication for only two weeks, I noticed right away I would go less often to the toilet, and it was much easier to dispense the urine.   Unfortunately I had to stop taking this as the medications side effects outweighed the benefits. I found that I would have incredibly intense mood swings, aggression, feel clumsy and dizzy all the time. Blurry vision. Memory problems or mind blanks. runny nose, weakness, tiredness.  I am now trying Betmiga.. lets see','I battled a nasty UTI for over a month &amp; went through 3 different antibiotics till my doctor finally gave me this one. Makes you terribly sick to your stomach but in the end is completely worth it Felt completely back to normal in 2 days','Hey Guys,  It&039;s been 4 months since my last post as I wanted to give it a few months to see how this was going to work.  So, I have been on Trulicity for six months now with Metformin.  When I hit the five month period the diarrhea, gas, sulphur belching finally subsided.  I now longer have any of those side effects.  However, I still haven&039;t lost any weight at all, but I think that was because when I first started Trulicity I was taking it with Glimepiride and that one has a side effect of weight gain so I think the two meds were fighting each other lol.  I have been back on the Metformin with Trulicity for about a week now, so we will see what this does.  I was diagnosed as  stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD 3) so I am watching diet closely.','Intuniv did not work for my son; he was bouncing off the walls while he was taking it, and having major issues in class It seems to work the opposite on him','Used pain medicines for 14 years (fentanyl 40 mcg and lortab 10mg). Excellent results after using Suboxone.',Fair,'My pain management doctor put me on Butrans patches about 6 weeks ago 5 mg dose. The first box of four was a lifesaver. No more agony at work. Able to sleep. Did more in two weekends than I had in two years. I&039;m hoping to bump up to the ten mg dose soon to cut down on my Norco. I have had chronic pain for many years and have been through many medicines including Oxycontin. This patch is the best so far.','I got heart palpitations, really bad - like almost constant. I was taking the 40 mcg one puff twice a day. I switched to flovemt and all is well.','My mother died from lung cancer. Her last hope of this medication. Within a couple months she was gone','Abilify 20 mg. I am a patient diagnosed with disorganized schizophrenia, depression,  schizoaffective disorder, bipolar.  I have experienced a sensitivity to my emotions, as well as how I react to my feelings.  I really don&039;t feel out of the normal with any &quot;sexual frustration&quot;...and I wouldn&039;t say this has increased/decreased.  I feel less anxious on the medication, and seemingly more at ease with myself when I take this medication.  It is a hard step to have people telling you that you actually do better on this pill, when half your life ago, you didn&039;t have &quot;mental illness&quot;, and suddenly you become someone else.   My weight did fluxuate when on this drug.  But I feel it was due to stress factors outside of a regular environment.  I feel if you place yourself in good surroundings and support you do much better at being the person you are here to be.  I am so much happier in life with a routine.  I feel like I only referred to enlongated periods of sleep because of depression, and events surrounding certain time frames hence thoughts, and reactions. Abilify (aripiprazole) My instant reaction from this drug is concern for my well-being.  I am nervous because I am one of the people taking this drug till the stars fade, every day to my last.  My doctors all seem to say the same thing, and that is, &quot;This medication is working for you&quot;.  I do blood tests when I go into the Hospital freqently, and they are not finding anything off the charts and everything is always normal with my vitals.  My thought is, how do they consider this medication works for me?  Because I am not showing side effects?  Because I am accepting?  I feel I have to hold patience, my own value, what I care about around me to help better myself mentally and my virtue.  I feel that I am just not the type of person to curbside answers to things we wonder deeply about, I guess.   I don&039;t know if there are any people who would agree then that I should ask if there are any women who have taken abilify during a pregnancy?  Just wondering what the reaction is...  Is my question?  I am a 30 year old female diagnosed with Mental Illness starting in 2004.  I started to take Abilify 20 mg. in 2004 to present.  Overall, since this medication has not been threatening to me, I feel I should embrace it.','I&039;ve been having UTIs for 7 years, my most recent one has lasted 24 days so far. Because of this I went to the doctor and they prescribed me pyridium twice a day. I was very hopeful but unfortunately it didn&039;t work. The burning while urinating is still there and I&039;ve been on it for three days so far. Also discomfort all hours of the day down there. It may work well for others but my body doesn&039;t accept it, it did nothing. Going to the doctor was useless, go straight to the urologist','Been taking these due to 2 back surgeries within a 9 month period. Doesn&039;t really help with my muscle spasms.','I have had great experience so far with Latuda. I started taking 40 mg in Nov., and it worked great for about a week, then I crashed again. Dr. put it up to 80 mg and I&039;ve been great ever since. I&039;m afraid, though, because my sex drive has completely disappeared, and if it&039;s the Latuda, I&039;m going to have to go off it-and I hate to go off something that&039;s working so well. However, I&039;m also on a pretty high dose of Lexapro, and the Dr. thinks it&039;s more likely to be a side effect of that, so we&039;re decreasing that and hopefully that will work, because otherwise I&039;m feeling really good. I&039;m really afraid I&039;ll have to go off it.','Love this, no mouth sores, or ulcers like Wellbutrin gave me. I COMPLETELY QUIT SMOKING...this works.','Never again After being on depo I was suppose to b an ideal candidate the first 6 months was ok bit moody but fine no weight gain but then something changed I was constantly bleeding and getting horrible hormone spots I normally have clear skin mood swings were increasing. After 14 months I decided to have it taken out and that was an ordeal they can b very tricky for the doc remove. So 3 anesthetics and a few stitches later its out. It&039;s simply not worth the hassle','Was on this med for 5 years. Worked fine but not great. Stopped the panic attacks and gave me relief of every day nervousness that I was experiencing. Took months for the side effects to diminish when I first started taking it. What did not leave - insomnia, night sweats, lack of sex drive and poor orgasms (or no orgasms at all).','I was put on Yasmin for 6 months to regulate my cycle and reduce acne flare-ups and it was the worst 6 months of my life. I gained 20lbs that did NOT come off easily after stopping the pill, experienced horrible mood swings, had HEAVIER periods, acne breakouts, breakthrough bleeding, and I was nauseous all the time. This pill seems to agree with most people but it definitely did not agree with me. I went on Femcon a year after stopping Yasmin and experienced virtually no side effects.','I love my Butrans patch And it has relieved more than half of my pain, and I know this because I only have to take less than half of my pain killers now that I am on the patch I change my patch every Saturday, but if I miss 24 hours my pain starts to reside again. If you are not a heavy drinker I would advise trying this patch','I have been on this for 8 months and sad to say it&039;s caused nothing but my self esteem to become lower. I&039;ve gained 10 lbs out of no where. I&039;m only 22 and have a fast metabolism. I thought it started to slow down but it didn&039;t make sense. My breasts got smaller, I have lost complete sex drive, my breasts aren&039;t sensitive anymore at all like they used to be and I&039;m so emotional, even crying at times. The only thing I can say is that it is 100\% effective but not worth what it has done to my body. Not only that but I started breaking out on my body and on my face as well.','I was off birth control for a while considering getting pregnant. I had used other types of birth control before, the pill, the patch, etc. I decided to get back on birth control but didn&039;t want to worry about taking a daily pill so I requested the Nuvaring. When I started the Nuvaring I felt it inside my body and had a lot of cramps. A few days later I started experiencing more cramps and very strong upper stomach pain. They were so bad I missed work for a week. Finally I ended up going to the ER and they couldn&039;t figure out what was wrong. I finally asked the doctor and it was the Nuvaring side effects.','I took the Prepopik for my first colonoscopy (I&039;m 25) and I found it to be very effective. The orange flavor was very tolerable. I had no bad cramps or terrible side effects with it, but I had taken magnesium citrate the night before and that had already cleaned me out somewhat. My only issue was I ended up so dehydrated that I showed up to my colonoscopy with a fever. Try to drink as much fluid as you can with this prep I drank plenty, but there was more liquid coming out of me than going in. Overall, I would recommend the Prepopik. On a side note, my insurance didn&039;t cover it, but the office I go to had it available. I recommend asking your office if they have it available if insurance won&039;t cover it at the pharmacy.','I just hit my three month point on tretinoin .05\% and I&039;m so happy. I was really  depressed about my skin during the first two months because I&039;ve never had bad acne and the cream made me have horrible acne. But I knew that was the worst part of it and after that was over I would be fine. I&039;ve inly had two zits since then and I&039;m only left with scars which is fine. Try it out even if you&039;re scared because I was too and I&039;m so glad i did. It&039;s worth it','it caused me to gain 30 pounds','Best treatment for acne I have used I&039;ve gone through accutane, many face washes, retinol creams, and other forms of birth control. Some other forms of birth control just make acne worse, depending on the type of progestin in it. You need the least androgenic type possible, and sprintec has worked the best for me Nearly clear skin. Takes about 5-6 months to fully work, but it does work.','I started taking Zepatier three days ago No sides effects till now I would like to share only this that I feel a slight pain in the back of the head.

My husband and I tried for a year. I have a blocked Fallopian tube. I had to use estrogen medicine also because my uterine lining was too thin. Then my doctor had me use HCG shot to stimulate ovulation since Clomid can apparently mess up if/when ovulation occurs. I took the HCG shot over 2 weeks ago. I noticed some weird symptoms a few days ago and I just took multiple pregnancy tests. And I&039;m pregnant So Clomid worked great for me so far.

Yes, it helps some. for me it is less effective than flonase and Benadryl together.','I had a tummy tuck on Dec 18. The surgery was painful but the constipation from opioids from the surgery was just as bad. My plastic surgeon wasn&039;t familiar with treating OIC so I called my primary care physician. She gave me Amitiza 24mcg. It took almost two days but it was amazing and I was so thankful. I had to remain on opioids for three weeks and the Amitiza worked so well I haven&039;t had any issues Thank you Amitiza','My experience during the nexplon is great not a pregnancy yet.

After several weeks of increasingly worsening panic attacks at work, I ended up in the hospital. A year ago my psych Dr switched me from cymbalta to a mood stabilizer and things were good until November as stress at work increased.  I was depending on too much bromazepam to get through the day.  My GP started me on 50 mg of Zoloft and my anxiety was so bad also tremors for 4 weeks I was sure I would have to quit working or cut my hours.  But this Monday on week 5 was amazing.  I still have some anxiety but I seem to be able to handle it now.  It&039;s like I have my confidence back.

It will help ease the release. There can be different amount of time you can expect the recommended dosage to work. For me it&039;s best taken on an empty stomach. No food for 4 hours or more helps speed the desired effect. If it&039;s been several days since you normally have movements it will also take longer for the effects to begin. Drink water, as much as you possibly can. If diarrhea occurs cut back on water. Take the prescribed dose, not more. Drinking lots of water along with sufficient fiber in my diet has become much easier than fighting with constant constipation.','do not take this medicine without the supervision of an endroconologist.

Had a friend tell me her dad got bitten by a cat and he ended up in the hospital and almost died from an infection. Lucky me from my experience I knew to seek medical attention immediately. Anyone bitten by a cat should know they have about an 85\% chance of infection and need to take it very seriously or you&039;ll end up in hospital.','So yes the first use was an experience. I had been so raw from constant itching that seemed to get worse within a few hours. I applied the cream to my lady parts and talk about wanting to take a cheese grater to your down under itchy fire parts. I had to take some Benadryl to help the itching. The vaginal insert of the cream wasn&039;t bad until it melts....and then it gets itchy inside your lady cave so to speak. After the first hour it seemed to calm down a lot I shouldn&039;t have waited so long to have done something about it. I never had any thick discharge so I thought it was just a little irritated.

Hopefully my period comes soon.','My ears were ringing like crazy, I was almost to start break down and cry, but I was reading on one guys experience on how to best the ringing and everything he went thru I was going thru so I stsrted to do exactly what he said is to tune it out cause the more you think about it the worse it gets because with titinus you csn become your own worst enemy. So I keep reading on other testimonials and read alot  of people took zanax and it seemed to quite the ringing down.  So I had a zanax 0.5mg took it also because I couldnt sleep, the next day I woke up with a slight ringing and as the day progressed it went completely away Thank the lord.I truly believe that this oh s a condition thats related to the nrevous system there is s cure out.','I started Prozac as one of my first anti depressants for MDD   It made me horribly sick. I was nauseous all day, and wouldn&039;t eat for days at a time. I stayed on it to try and get thorough the side effects but they wouldn&039;t stop, I was throwing up every other day  One day I woke up and I started to violently shake, This lasted for over 12 hours until I ended up in the hospital with Tachycardia.   This was a horrible experience and months later I still have stomach and heart issues, I&039;m on new medications now, But because of my bad experience I get very anxious when I take them','Intake Effexor XR 375 mg, and lorazepam for depression and anxiety. My doctor added Abilify and I took it in mornings. It made me foggy. I moved it to Bertie and sleep better overall. I have noticed an increase in irritability which equates to feeling extremely angry by 3 pm daily. I&039;ve rearranged my lorazepam to reduce that but need more time. I&039;m also having restlessness which almost feels manic. We shall see. Increased cravings for sweets.','I am torn by the Nuvaring. The convenience is great. There is no daily time to take a pill, only once a month which can easily be marked on a calender or put into a phone. It never falls out, I never feel it and changing it is simple, too. I would give the Nuvaring a 10 out of 10 just based upon the simplicity and the price is really reasonable, too. But, there are some downsides (for me personally). For the first few months, I did not notice side effects, although they are there. I have a VERY low tolerance to alcohol when on the Nuvaring. Very emotional, tired, and strung out all the time. I was on the pill before and none of these happened. I also have longer periods. It&039;s worth a try, every girl seems to have a different experience','worked well for its immediate effects, did nothing noticeable in the long term.','Made me very sick','It&039;s nothing. This did absolutely nothing for me. I didn&039;t even have any side-effects, it was like taking a sugar pill or a placebo.','I took two doses of this medicine as instructed, and afterwards experienced severe headache, bad stomach cramping and loose stools.','I&039;m 30 years old.  I started having really bad skin about 2 years ago from maybe stress in my life.  But, I tried EVERYTHING to get rid of it and it just got worse.  I finally went to a dermatologist and she put me on spironolactone.  My skin started getting better in about two weeks. I LOVED it. I&039;ve been taking it for about 6 months and I get compliments from Makeup artist and models (I&039;m a hairstylist) about how good my skin is.  Another plus for me is my breasts went from a small B to a C I decided to stop taking it for a week and my breasts went small again and my skin is getting a little oily. So I&039;m going back on. I only take one a day.','I&039;ve suffered from panic attacks and anxiety for years.  I took Paxil for many years, but its effectiveness waned, and I hated the weight gain and sexual side-effects that came with it.  I switched to Luvox, starting with 25mg and it worked miracles.  Eventually, I had to move up to 50mg and now for the last two years 75mg.  I have had no adverse effects, and it has been a lifesaver.  Eventually, when my son was diagnosed with panic disorder (certainly inherited from me, much like I inherited it from my mother), his doctor tried Luvox for him, too.  His assumption was that our genetic similarity and our similar diagnosis might be treated by the same medicine.  He was right. Both my son and I are living anxiety-free, panic attack-free lives.','Awful medicine, the worst. The side effects outweigh the benefit.  Headache the first night, leg and back pain, Sensitive skin,  just awful. Pain got worse and worse. I changed my meds to ciproflaxcin. I have used this in the past so hopefully, it will continue to help. I even questioned the doc at urgent care to see if I can take cipro and she offered macrobid. Maybe this urgent care and this medication is something they get a deal on....stay away from macrobid.','I&039;ve been on Latuda for a little under 2 and a half years. It almost completely stopped my psychotic symptoms except I still hear voices now and then, mainly when I try to go to sleep, but there are no delusions or paranoia while on the drug. I take cogentin in combination with it because it causes me to shake a lot. Main side effects I experience include anhedonia, shakiness, jaw clenching, and inability to sit still. However, I&039;m happy with it because it actually works, while other antipsychotic meds I tried did not, and it doesn&039;t cause the endless hunger that I experienced with drugs like Saphris, Haldol, Zyprexa, and Risperdal. It should be noted I am at the max daily dose, which is 160mg.','I&039;ve seriously only been using Epiduo for four days and have seen A HUGE improvement. My skin is a little dry but I use Cetaphil moisturizer to balance it out. I am also using Doxycycline along with the topical treatment (Epiduo) and my acne is getting soooo much better. LOVE IT','This cream is absolutely horrible. I will admit the cream initially does what is says it will do, gets rid of the redness. However this is completely temporary, around 6 hours in my experience. What comes afterward is a serious rebound. I spent the day outside in the cold weather (normally a trigger for me, which would normally warrant redness) and when I came back in around 6 hours later my face has never felt hotter in my life. My skin burned and was unbelievably deep red, it looked as if I had held my face up against a fire. This lasted around 2-3 hours. I used it once more thinking my skin needed to get used to it and the results were even worse. I threw away all of my samples after 2 days.','My blood pressure has been around 160/100. Doctor prescribed Azor 40/10. Just 4 hrs later my reading showed 120/82. I was amazed. I am now on it daily. Thanks to Azor.','I&039;m 16 and  I have been on Loestrin 24 for about a week and half. The day I got them (and started taking them) was a day after I stopped my period and two days ago I started my period it is like a normal. I don&039;t think I have gained weight due to me being sick and therefore don&039;t eat as much as I normally do but I did not lose weight like I normally do when I&039;m sick. I have been getting cramps which I don&039;t normally get except the first one or two days of my period. I have been really depressed and I&039;m not a depressed person. I mean I was crying over the stupidest things like my mom not cooking dinner when I wasn&039;t even hungry. I&039;m going to talk to my doctor tomorrow.','So far loving this. Stomach pain has almost disappeared, haven&039;t had an attack in over a week. Down side is have to be near a bathroom about an hour after taking it but that is manageable. Hopefully it continues to work. Time will tell.','I used it at bed time along with Paxil. I have anxiety and at times insomnia. The lower the dose(@ 7.5 mg), the more it becomes a sleep aid. It worked well for both anxiety and insomnia.','I suffer from chronic pain due to severe arthritis and stenosis in my lumbar spine. I take vicodin as needed to alleviate &039;breakthrough&039; pain, i.e., occasional pain so great that my usual daily maintenance dose of Embeda ER (morphine/naltrexone) cannot relieve it. It works well, with the usual opioid side effects, hence a score of 8.','I just started this medication on April 1st and after 3 days I started seeing the effects and I can see it&039;s taking it&039;s course and working so far. The doctor started me on 40mg two times a day for 4 months. So far only side effect is dryness which was to be expected. ','Been dealing with restless leg syndrome.for about 2 years. It kept me from falling asleep. First they gave me flexiril. And it did nothing. Than a miracle came about and I was prescribed reprinol and my legs haven&039;t twitched since . Amazing drug I must say. My sleep has improved greatly','I dreaded the side-effects and had NONE.  I had the intravenous infusion three days before Christmas 2011 and was scared that I would be flattened by the supposed side-effects like flu-like symptoms, bone ache and so forth and was pleasantly surprised.  I am having my second one in just ten days time and hopefully it will be a repeat of the first one.','This is a very good medication IMO.  When you titrate up to the dose intended, you will notice subtle differences.  Many times I have thought that this had flattened me out but when I backed off the dose, symptoms came roaring back.  No noticeable side effects for me.  Helps stability very well, maybe the cause of some anxiety not much tho.','My time with skyla has been an absolute breeze. Ms. Skyla and i have been together since late october 2015 and it has been great. I must admit that the insertion is a bit painful,but you will soon forget. I got cramps for about a weekafter insertion. Nothing that a littlw ibuprofen couldnt tackle. I urge anyone who is thinking about skyla to just do it. I promise it is worth it. Please remember that pain is subjective. Meaning it just depends on the person. ','Have tried Paxil and Lexapro which sent me into hyper-panic and GAD. I was about to give up on medicines and accept my miserable anxiety as a fact of life when my Doctor recommended Buspirone. I noticed my anxiety began to taper the second day I took the medication. No real side effects to speak of through my first week. The one thing it has delivered for me, HOPE','I have been suffering with this anxiety problem for years and it was starting to interfere with my life.  I am a confident person socially, but my fear of presentations was huge and I would my voice would tremble to the extent where it sounded like I was full on crying. I researched medication for this fear and found propanolol. My doctor prescribed me with 80mg Half Inderal (Propanolol) and despite what some say, he was not hesitant about giving me a prescription and said he regularly gives it to musicians/public speakers etc. It has worked wonders for me, I no longer embarrass my self and now feel happy and confident. You may still feel nervy, but the adrenaline does not kick in. I have not suffered any symptoms and only take it seldomly.','My 9 year old son has been on various medicines for ADHD since he was 6. We just switched to Focalin 10 mg about 2 weeks ago. We are noticing that by about 1:00 in the afternoon it is completely out of his system and there is no focus. We are going to try a booster dose of 5 mg in the afternoon. I&039;m going to talk to our doctor about lowering his morning dose because he feels shaky and tired, which I thought would have subsided by now. His focus is terrific but I wonder if we can get the same results by knocking down the dose a bit and adding the booster. Other than that, his sleep and eating habits are the same. Whew','I love Lutera. I am very sensitive to other forms of birth control. Lutera has been one of the only kinds I can take.   Pros: light periods, no cramping, no intense side effects, bigger boobs.  Cons: Brown periods, slight weight gain.   I also tend to get a bit emotional 1 or 2 days before my period....however I am always an emotional person so this could just be me. I have been on Lutera for 6 years ?','I took Jolivette 6 weeks after I went home with my first baby.  A year after we went on vacation for four days and I forgot it at home. After vacation I took it and everything was fine. A week later I got my period. I thought it wasn&039;t a big deal, or was maybe because I miss all those days. It last 5 days. 2 weeks after that again but now lasting 7 days. Then I started to get my period every week and now every 3 days Lasting 7 days Worked amazing in the beginning but I messed it up.','I was prescribed this medicine for bronchitis, 500mg. for 7 days. It really cleared up the bronchitis, but left me with bad tendonitis in my right leg.  No telling how long this will go on.  I can barely walk when I first get up in the morning, although it gets better with gentle exercise.  I too have noticed crazy dreams, no dizziness, but I think it is causing me to make some bad decisions.  Do not take this medicine for anything under any conditions.  Find some other drug.  The side effects are unpredictable, come on after you have already stopped taking it, and are miserable.  I&039;m going to try some of the remedies the other reviewers have mentioned.','Helped very bad shingles outbreak in about 3 days.','I was having severe attacks several times a day and within two days on tegretol they stopped. I still get very minor twinges at times from trigger areas. It has been two weeks plus now and I can still recall beginning to brush my teeth and ending up on the floor, so I would be happy if I retain this level of control forever.','I have been using Qsymia for a little over 3 months. I have lost 50 pounds. I&039;m 30, have 1 child and couldn&039;t lose weight no matter how long I stayed in the gym. There is no magic pill that works for weight loss without DIET AND EXERCISE You need to do these things to see these type of results I will say in the beginning my side effects were awful I always felt tired but I pushed passed that and it went away. I have since gone off my blood pressure medicine as well. I would recommend following closely with your doctor if you are on BP meds though because my blood pressure dropped so quick I was fainting. Not from Qsymia but from getting healthy so fast.','I try not to take medicine unless I am really sick but my doctor recommended I take cephalexin for a small cyst on my eye lid.  I decided to try it because antibiotics are one of the medicines I believe are very good when you are sick and your body needs a little help to heal.  My dosage was three 500mg per day for 10 days.  After the first day I developed stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I was not sure if it was due to the medicine so I continued to take the cephalexin for two more days.   When the condition did not get any better I stopped taking the cephalexin.  It has now been a week since I first took the cephalexin and I still have stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I advised my doctor&039;s office of my problem but they have not called me yet.','I took Aviane for about 3 years. I gained very little weight when I began taking it, but quickly dropped the lbs when I started paying attention to how I was eating. I never had any issues with an irregular period or acne, but my main side effect was moodiness. It took me a couple of years to figure out why I&039;d become this hyperemotional person, but then after much research, realized it was the Aviane. I began to pay attention to my moods and regulate my mood swings, which helped. I&039;ve been off the pill for over a year now, but if I had to go back on birth control, I would choose this one again.','I was put on this birth control when I was 15 I was 150lbs I gained 50lbs then I replaced it and got a new one and I&039;m gaining even more weight it barely helps with periods anymore my periods last for 5 weeks at a time now and barely anytime in between to have a break','I&039;ve been on this medication almost a full month. I never feel hungry and have been eating WAY less than I ever have, however the scale has not moved. Bad heartburn has been my only side effect. I&039;ll try it one more month and then if no weight loss, I&039;m going to stop. Disappointed...and I had to pay $1,000 out of pocket','This med caused me to hear internal voices (auditory hallucinations, but in my head). Made me paranoid, anxious, scared to be alone, tired, nauseated, no appetite,  and felt schizophrenic. Started at 50 mg, coming off immediately, per my PDoc. I hope it gives you relief, as most seem satisfied. Bummer it wasn&039;t my life saver.','Depo has been great for relief of pain from endometriosis. I am on my 3rd shot. No more period, but I do spot the whole month before the next shot is due. I am hoping that will stop as my body gets used to it more. The shot is painless, the only side effect I have noticed is minor weight gain and my sex drive has decreased a bit. I am okay with that at least the pain is gone. I got scared reading what everyone had to say about this drug and almost didn&039;t get it. I am glad I took the chance to see how &quot;I&quot; reacted to it. Everyone is different. I am very satisfied with it.','I&039;ve been on Jolessa for 6 months.  I decided to try this because I get bad headaches during my period (even though they&039;d only last 3 days, 4 days at most) and I wanted to avoid it altogether.  The first two months, it was great.  Then my period arrived a month early and the bleeding lasted for 25 days, mostly light.  I had already picked up my next 90 day pack so I figured I&039;d try to get through that and if I still had the bleeding, I&039;d talk to my doctor about another birth control.  No need to do that because Jolessa is now working perfectly for me.  It&039;s been wonderful not having a period for a few months.  I&039;d recommend this birth control to anyone.','I am female in her early 30&039;s - about 3 years ago I developed adult acne after years of relatively clear skin. Benzyol peroxide had been my miracle acne product but then I developed contact dermatitis and could no longer use it :( I honestly could not go more than a day without a new pimple developing despite using other prescription acne grade products, vitamin A as well as expensive spa treatments. I have been on Aczone about a month and have had instant results, I have not had a cystic pimple since. I still get blackheads and have milia on my chin/jawline but no pimples/whiteheads/cysts to speak of and have had no issues with dry skin. The product is pricey but I will save in the long run not wasting my money on others that don&039;t work.','I smoked for 32 years and tried different times and products to help me stop but always failed.  My doctor and I agreed for me to try the Nicoderm CQ patch and it&039;s really helping me. I have no urges to smoke and am now on Day 8.  The only thing I found out is that I have red swollen itchy skin where the patches were worn. Need to talk to the doctor but office is closed on the weekends.  I&039;m thinking I could be allergic to them but don&039;t want to stop them because they are working for me','Gave this high priced, 12 hour cough &quot;suppressant&quot; in the kiddie version, to my 6 year old. The only thing it suppressed, was his ability to sleep. Worse product I&039;ve ever purchased for him.','I&039;m Planning to be  put in 17 Days in residential treatment and follow it up with vivitrol injection.  I just worry because I hear that it&039;s incredibly painful, but I an only really trying to get away from the subs... I&039;m down to less than 6mg but I&039;ve been IV&039;ing them.  I still wouldn&039;t think my bupe dose is high enough to worry about after 15 - 17 days...  A friend did tell me that if you are clean enough to be eligible for it, it will make you feel like a million bucks I&039;m extremely hopeful, and was hoping for some insight and / or advice, but I believe this is an awesome chance to get my life back, even though I am afraid of the sword length rig they use to do it...  I just hope it all goes as well as planned, or better...  VeryAnxiousNow','I was prescribed Restasis by my ophthalmologist due to severe dry eye caused by Accutune. I was given a card that gave me a discount since I did not have private health insurance and used each vile over 2-3 days so that it became effectively very cheap for me to use. I had side effects at first, burning eyes and blurred vision. I was told it takes a minimum of 3 months to see any benefits so I kept using it. It worked almost too well, as my eyes started producing tears so much that my eyes would water all the time. I stopped using the product after 1 year, and my eyes have improved so much I no longer need to use it, although I still use regular over the counter eye drops (Systane Balance) once or twice a day as needed','I started 5mg of olanzapine last night. I have not slept or felt calm in a couple months. I have dealt with Bipolar 1 and ADHD for many years. I went to my Psychiatrist and was told that for my condition I should not be on things like Celexa that I was taking at 40mg at night. Those serotonin medications can hype me up especially at night. So the only other medicine I take is Inderal LA 120mg for tremors I have from a neurological condition since childhood. I slept great last night for the first time in a long time. I also feel much more at ease in gathering my thoughts and focus. I just hope it continues and I do my part in staying stable too.','Great product I have been on other drugs that gave me back side effects-rash, itching, dry mouth, constipation, headache, dizziness, back pain, etc. I urinate on average 20-40 times a day every approx 15-20 minutes, after using the patch I went as long as 2 hours without using restroom. my skin is irritated and red but better than spending my whole day in the bathroom. I cant believe my doctor didn&039;t put me on this over the counter drug first before spending hundreds of dollars on prescription medications. I have suffered for over 30 yrs with the issue of urgency and frequency this is a miracle for me.  Praise the LORD','I was essentially mis-prescribed Actiq when I should have been getting fentanyl patches for my cancer pain.  This caused problems with both bolus dosing (transient overdosage) and build-up of opioid tolerance with the Actiq that have not been nearly as great a problem with fentanyl patches.    Other patients may have different experiences; however for chronic cancer pain, the patches might be considered before use of Actiq.','My experience with this product is a lot different from everyone else&039;s. I have never had a really really bad acne just a few spots here and there so when I went to see the dermatologist they prescribed me this gel to put on every night over my whole face. Firstly everything was going fine I didn&039;t see a difference and then after a week my skin had cleared up and it look flawless. However one night when I put my cream on and then waking up on the next morning my skin was literally burnt and my forehead was covered in those little spots which was terrible and they looked even worse with make up on because it was extremely bumpy. I stopped using the gel and it when away but was really bad.','I absolutely love Nexplanon Ladies, at first I was super hesitant but I had to get off the Trinessa birth control because it caused me too much bloating and I was miserable 3 weeks out of the month. I was so excited to get the implant but the reviews I read freaked me out. The process was super easy and fast. The most uncomfortable part was the numbing process (it stung a bit). I didn&039;t feel the implant insertion at all. There was bruising for about a week and it itched quite a bit but it went away after a week once it was fairly healed. As far as side effects, I felt a bit moody for about 2 weeks and I had a headache for a few days when I first got the implant. I&039;ve had ZERO bleeding and NO weight gain.','I&039;m 27 w/ two kids. After my second child was born in 2008 I suffered from almost daily tension/migraine headaches. I wanted to try Mirena as a solution to birth control and possibly help my headaches. After 4 months my headaches are slightly better but I have had some noticeable side effects; 10-15 lbs weight gain, increased discharge, longer periods, and cramping after sex or exercise. ','It saved my life--what can I say?','Update:  My skin initially cleared up for the First week but then the next 2-3 weeks were horrible with a lot of breakouts  For the first 3 weeks my skin was so red, painful, dry and peeling. Then all of a sudden everything went away...  My acne is minimal/almost completely gone after a little over a month and my skin feels so hydrated Such a great product','When I was a 15 year old freshman in high school I broke out with severe acne. In literally one week my skin went from perfectly clear to large acne blotches on my cheeks, chin and neck that were painful to touch. After trying everything in the arsenal at the time (monocycline, benzaclIn, finacea, etc.) my dermatologist recommended Accutane. My only side effects were ridiculously chapped lips, dry skin on my face, and some joint pain. After a month and a half of treatment my acne was gone completely, and my skin clearer everyday thereafter. I was so depressed with the acne but this medicine changed my life for the better as I have never needed to use/take another acne medication following that 4 or 5 month treatment.','2mg of xanax works perfectly for my panic attack when i feel one coming on i take one 2mg pill and it takes it away and i am no longer being run by my panic attack.','This medication is amazing After 3 days of being extremely sick, I started to feel amazing, I am now 1 month into it and am so happy all the time and have no depressive thoughts at all. It kind of blocks out any sad thoughts. Works perfectly for me.','Had the Liletta inserted in November. The process overall wasn&039;t bad, but I also had numbing injections which helped so much with the pain. Just a couple cramps and it was over. Stopped having a period after three months, and the weird cramps I kept feeling stopped around 5 months. Everything was great until I noticed my clothes weren&039;t fitting anymore. I&039;ve gained 10 - 12 pounds despite months of a very clean diet, counting calories, and frequent exercise. I also started losing my hair a few weeks ago, and began sprouting chin hair that I didn&039;t have before, which is making me feel very depressed. I am beyond frustrated and am having it removed in a few days.','It works very well','I was recently referred to a endocrinologist and he started me on Trulicity and Jardiance. I&039;ve tried to take Byetta in the past but had to stop because it made me very sick. I lost weight. But that was because I was throwing up all day. Effective weight loss method but I do NOT recommend it  I&039;ve taken one dose of Trulicity and while I do have mild nausea it is not bad and I have switched from coffee to green tea in the morning. Really helps. That I would recommend. Sugar levels have not dropped significantly but they are dropping. Guess one week won&039;t work wonders and I have to wait a bit. I don&039;t know if it is the Trulicity or the Jardiance or the combo of both but I have managed to lose 7 pounds in 5 days.','I have been a long term sufferer of chronic pain from Fibromyalgia, DDD, Scoliosis, Sciatica, Arthritis, Migraines and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome since 1992.,. After starting out with the over the counter meds, then moving to prescription Motrin, Day trip, Rendering, and numerous anti depressants, my doctor began prescribing Vicodin 5/500. At first they worked, but after 3months, nothing So I went back to my doctor and told him. He then proceeded to put me on 7.5/750, again they worked for me no longer after 3 months. To make a long story short, I am now and have been on MS Contin, 60mg x two times a day and 100mg at bedtime. For my break-thru pain I am on Oxycodone 30mg x two. I&039;m here to say that I have a life once again','I was diagnosed with adult onset Diabetes last Dec. I started on  Metformin 750 and almost immediately my fasting glucose dropped  to 94. That is what it has been since but I have been bothered with  neuropathy for  months. I tried Lyrica for 3 months and it did  absolutely nothing for the pain. I am presently taking gabapentin  300 mg at bedtime and it helps slightly. The cost for the Lyrica  was money out the window.','My genius psychiatrist started me on this drug in the fall of 2008.  The first few weeks I felt even worse than before I had started taking the fluoxetine.  After many months on the drug I was eventually taking 400mg a day, and having manic thoughts &amp; episodes.  My psychiatrist decided I was bi-polar and then started me on seroquel (rather than give me a break for my nervous system to re-adjust to it&039;s natural state), which I also ended up taking for about 6 months and at about the same dose.  In retrospect I wish I hadn&039;t taken either fluoxetine(Prozac) or seroquel(Quetiapine).','took one 25mg to help me sleep however the next day I felt awful like id been drugged just couldn&039;t wake up this lasted all day.i wont be taking them again .my wife on the other hand takes them every night with no problems','The first 3 years I was on nexplanon I had no problems, except for when I first got it interested I bled for 6 months straight (very light). Then after that everything was fine. After the 3 years were up I decided to get another one inserted since I had no major problems with the first one. That&039;s when it went downhill. I gained about 20 pounds, became anxious about everything, moods began to change, also had severe pain in my ovaries. I got an ultrasound to make sure there weren&039;t any cysts and everything was normal but I continued to have severe pain. Finally, I decided to get it removed and everyting has been good so far no more pain, moods are better, and I&039;ve lost weight.','I was really glad that I experienced none of the possible side effects. After four weeks I did notice my mood getting better, but after that some things happened in my life (my dog had surgery, a break-up, a hair experiment gone wrong) that I was not able to deal with and I got worse. I felt myself spiraling downward and my anxiety shot way up. It&039;s month number two and I just switched to lexapro. Hope it helps.','I wrote my expirence with this pill before, back when I started and it actually worked.    I&039;ve been on it for 6 months now and let me tell you, i&039;m already going to the doctor to switch.   Sure, no babies. That part was effective.  But eventually, I ended up having cramps again (they had gone away when i first started) my acne flared up like nobody&039;s buisness, my headaches are horrible and daily, and i&039;ve been suffering from depression. I never have any motivation, i burst out crying for no reasons, and I get angry out of no where. This is very out of character for me.   I&039;m disapointed but hopefully I will find a better option.','I&039;ve had this implant for 7 months now, I&039;ve had no problems except for real bad acne breakouts. I&039;ve alway suffered from acne here and there but it&039;s gotten bad after the implant. I have real bad breakouts all over my cheeks, and chin. At first I thought it was something I ate but I did some research and found out that this implant contains progesterone which can cause acne. I&039;m planning to remove this implant. Look out for breakouts after implant,','The only thing that ever worked for me and for up to 5 years at a time','I&039;m 31 &amp; have used many birth control options, beginning with the patch @ 19 then going to the pill within the year. My MD RX&039;d me the loestrin 1/20 a year ago. This past year proved the best for me as far as overall health: fewer skin breakouts, MUCH lighter &amp; shorter periods (i frequently donate blood and am not iron-defficient anemic), better sex drive (husband loves), and moodiness not as bad. I have gained 7lb of weight but cannot pinpoint it directly to this pill as I have chosen a less healthy lifestyle the past year. The only negative about this pill for me was I did not stay on a 28 day cycle and had breakthrough bleeding. Today, MD changed me to loestrin 1.5/30 for this reason.','I got this inserted 3 years ago, my arm hurt for one day with no bruising, and then I literally forgot about it for the remaining time. No periods ever, and never once pregnant. No weight gain. Most convenient form of birth control ever used, but it may just be the way my body has reacted. Got it reinserted for the next 3 years and got some bruising, but not too bad.','Been taking this medication for 6 years.  I have a good stream and it was prescribed by my doctor because I wasn&039;t emptying my bladder fully due to a bladder that did not have the muscle tone that it once had.  It worked great for most of these years but due to my age, 85, I can&039;t always make it to the bathroom fast enough to urinate.  I&039;m going to stop taking it and see if there is a difference in reaching the bathroom before I have to let go of a full bladder.','First of all I&039;m not and never have been a smoker.

I&039;ve been taking this product for five yrs and the illness due to weather has decreased dramatically I had previously suffered from pneumonia due to worsening bronchitis at least twice a yr. I average once every three years now it is due to consistently taking this year round.','Used Cardura XL on/off for several years now and more regularly recently. Wanted new prescription after moving to Europe, however doctor didn&039;t now the product and recommended as alternative Tamsulosin (Pradif T) which did not provide any relieve with urinating especially at night (blocked). Switched back to my remaining Cardura XL and found equivalent product in Europe called Cardura CR. Just perfect flow, day and night No side effects.','I just want to say that after taking a lot of other anti-depressant meds, this is THE ONE Besides only having 1 side-effect (diarrhea), that went away after 2 wks, it&039;s really changed my life i recommend this to anyone who has tried other meds that have not worked','I am 29 and just had my second Mirena inserted a few days ago. It was painful, but the pain only lasts for around 30 seconds if it goes smoothly.  I have seizures, and have chosen Mirena because it does not interact with my medicines. Other forms of birth control have caused more seizures. I do not have this problem with Mirena. It has not affected my skin (although I currently use medication for acne I&039;ve had for years).  I like it because after it&039;s inserted, I can forget about it for a few years.  The only thing I&039;ve found inconvenient, is having a partner be able to feel the strings.  BUT my gyno said most men are not even aware.  ','I have noticed no difference in stream (5ml when I took the flow test) after 3 days using, and am unable to ejaculate. 25y/o male.','This is absolutely the best birth control I have ever used. I switched from Nexplanon to Ortho Evra, and if you are thinking of doing the same, I highly recommend it.  Let me list the reasons why: 1. Weight loss. I have lost 5lbs in one month, without even trying  I&039;m back to the weight I was before I started birth control...but my breasts are still birth control sized. 2. Sex drive. Mine had been non-existent since I went on Nexplanon in September. Now, stronger than ever. That might be a downside though, now that I think about it. 3. Skin- no acne 4. Predictable cycle. (On Nexplanon, I never knew when I was going to menstruate, which was about 90\% of the time). Now, a non issue. 5. Don&039;t have to remember everyday.','I&039;ve received spinal injections because after a serious car accident I&039;ve been left with severe pain and will do anything to relieve it. Anytime I get an injection, they give me propofol before the injection and I&039;m knocked out within a few seconds and then awake a few minutes after the procedure. After about 15 minutes I&039;m ready to get up and leave and am able to walk and function normally with absolutely no hangover or side effects.','Had open heart surgery and double mastectomy in a span of 2 years. Very painful nerve pain most of the time. Bio- Freeze (Roll- On) Definitely works for the pain. Unfortunately it has literally burned my chest.

Two days later I started having migraines, fits of crying, anxiety attacks, irritable, very depressed, and feeling almost convulsive.  When the doctor took me off the medicines, I slept for 15 hours, just getting up to have dinner and going back to bed.  This medicine is NOT for me.','OMG   I SWEAR I&039;M NOT A PAID PERSON  I&039;ve got a bad back and in the past I&039;ve used this and that with no success after spending all that money.

I lost nearly 10 lbs in a week','My Endo insisted I switch from lantus to tresiba.  I was quite stable on lantus and humalog for over 15 years but she said it was better.  I&039;ve been a diabetic for almost 30 years and so I was very hesitant to switch.  I should have listened to myself.  The first 3 weeks were okay but not better.  Then I started feeling breathless and fatigued.  It took me awhile? to realize it was the tresiba.  I switched back to lantus a week ago and I am already feeling better.  No more breathlessness or fatigue.  My blood sugars were worse on tresiba so it will take a bit to straighten out my a1c.  I really should have listened to my gut.  Just because it&039;s new doesn&039;t mean it&039;s better.','This drug causes persistent nausea in some users as per their website. For most people it goes away after a few weeks--but not all. Initially I was also itchy and a little weepy (went away after 2 weeks). If you have a history of being unusually nausea prone (ie pregnancy) in my experience you may wind up in the persistent nausea group. I will have to switch as I don&039;t want to be chained to zofran. Otherwise, worked fine as an alternative to paxil. Fewer side effects--unfortunately the one side effect it did cause is pretty debilitating in my case','Truly life changing for those with narcolepsy/cataplexy.','I&039;ve only had one dose of Lupron; before going on it I did my research. One side effect is HORRIBLE insomnia (which I have). I know not every single change in my body can be blamed on the Lupron. I have Endometriosis and the Lupron basically puts you in a state of menopause. Headaches, insomnia, sweats, mood swings were very bad the first couple of weeks; now my stomach hurts So I think I can pick and choose what the medicine is responsible for and the state of chemical menopause is doing to me.','I am 25 yrs old, no kids and have never been pregnant. After almost 10 years of being on the pill, my doctor and I decided it was time for some thing different. Insertion was very painful, the first one we were trying was faulty so I had to purchase another one right after to be placed. It was extremely uncomfortable, even after being advised to take 800mg of Motrin I had my boyfriend bring me to and from the doctor, which I would recommend. After I got home I placed a heating pad on my lower abdomen and slept for about 2 hrs After I woke up I felt like a completely different person I had no aches or pains, back to normal I would highly recommend this to any woman, there&039;s no more remembering I love it','I have been taking Zanaflex for about a year now and it has been wonderful for me.  I have Ankylosing spondylitis and fibromyalgia.  I have a very hard time sleeping at night but Zanaflex helps me sleep and keeps down the muscle pain.','Agree with the majority of reviews. Itching/burning is so much worse after immediate application. Side effects not accurately stated. Waste of money. Will never use again.','This medicine did nothing at all for my pain. Glad it works for some, but it didn&039;t for me','Hi, I&039;ve been using this product over 3years and I&039;m completely satisfied. My skin in super dry and It&039;s really really working for me. While I&039;m using this, my face is clear. I&039;ve tried everything but nothing worked except ACZONE   It&039;s expensive but totally worth it, give it a try.','I was having severe bleeding with large clots which lasted for 3 weeks. Finally saw the Doctor and he gave me 10mg for 10 days. This is day 9. I stopped bleeding 2 days ago. I love this medicine, really. I&039;m hungry more often, but that&039;s okay. Unsure what will happen when I stop taking it.','I&039;ve been taking Latuda 40mg once a day in the evening  for 1 month for BiPolar.  I had been on various meds throughout my life for depression started when I had postpartum with both my children.  I am 45 now and my children are 17/14. I was on was Lexapro for depressrion for quite sometime that seems to run its course with me. Oh was diagnosed with MS in 1992 so add that piece to the puzzel.As far as Latuda,  I have mixed feelings. It seems to help me with focus and cognitive deficiencies, which I could be MS related.  Depression is there but not as it was, but I still cry and at times stay in my head too long.  I seem to be more agitated with my children.  Ativan helps with Anxiety when needed. I will be seeing my psych tomorrow to discuss.','I have been on this for 2 days and already lost 3 pounds. I am not hungry at all and I love it so far.

I take a 50mg and like clockwork I am hard in 45 to 60 minutes. No worries about keeping the erection long enough to climax.  I can&039;t believe just how good this drug works. Side effects for me are minimal.','I have been on the Qysmia for 3 weeks now.  I wanted  to wait a few weeks  to give a review. I have a very slow metabolism so I  did not lose as much as some in the first two weeks  upon taking.  My weight started at 198.  I am down to 193. So I  have lost  5 lbs in 3 weeks.  But that  is with  out cardio.  My  appetite  is suppressed.  Dry mouth.  So drink a lot of water. Tingling almost numbness in my feet at times but it goes away shortly after. The  medication  if not covered  or with the free trial  is expensive.  So be prepared.  I guess it  is cheaper  than weight loss surgery.  But it&039;s no magic pill neither.  Like any other pill  you must eat right and exercise. To lose the weight.  Well that&039;s  my take anyway.','I been on it for two months. Started with the 145mg worked right of. Then the body got used to it didn&039;t go for 2 weeks. Now on 290mg. For 2 weeks. Alright at times. But give time too see how does. The only next step I can see is surgery. But gastrointestinal doctor says no surgery too fix. 30 years off constipation. What more can I take. Only 39. Now have other medical problem from straining do much over the years.','So much better than the creams.','I was prompted to write this after reading some of the negative reviews. God how I wish this would work for everyone. I have only been on it for around 7 months but my first scan was promising (I have bone metastasis and there were no new spots and previous lesions appeared smaller). I go for my next scan in a few weeks. I&039;m so fortunate in that I&039;ve had no side effects. Your neutrophils will dip and yes, I&039;m tired at times but what else is new. I know that some are experiencing terrible side effects but I wanted to chime in and say that not everyone experiences them. I do take spirulina pills and they seem to help get my neutrophils where they should be (above 1.0).

I&039;ve tried many different SS/SNRIs over the past 12 years &amp; they all made me have extreme suicidal thoughts. I had kind of given up hope on finding something that worked for me, but then a new psychiatrist recommended trying Wellbutrin.

','I&039;m a 27 year old white male in good shape but have always had high blood pressure...I&039;m guessing genetic. My blood pressure would run anywhere from 130-160 over 85-105. The doctor tried a diuretic which did nothing, and then a beta blocker which had horrible side effects. They finally tried 10mg of lisinopril and wow how great It almost immediately brought my blood pressure to 118/80&039;s. I actually cut my dose to 2.5 mg in the morning and 2.5 mg at lunch and my blood pressure stays perfect all day and night. I have had no side effects whatsoever and wouldn&039;t even know I was taking any medication if it weren&039;t for my lowered blood pressure. Highly recommend','I don&039;t think I noticed this at first or even realized the pill was the cause, but this pill gave me terrible headaches for 3-4 days during my period.  I am hungry and moody before my period. The period is very light, which is a plus, but I can&039;t stand the headaches.  It feels like I have a sinus infection and taking Advil non stop doesn&039;t help.  It&039;s not worth it.  I would LOVE to have cramps instead of headaches.','I have been taking Jardiance for just over a year - I have NOT experienced any side effects whatsoever - MORE importantly this drug has reduced my blood sugar levels to an average of 5 and has maintained this level, quite incredible as nothing else has worked previously - I have named Jardiance as the &quot;diabetic wonder drug&quot; although my Doctor keeps reminding me there is no such thing as a wonder drug - I disagree this is MY wonder drug - thank you Jardiance you have changed my life completely astonishing result.','I take all types of pain meds but Naproxen doesn&039;t last an hour before my cramps come back.

I&039;m due in February to take it out because my 5 years are up. It did not bother me at all to get it inserted. It was pretty easy, I had minor cramps after. I got it because I had gotten pregnant at 16 and had my daughter at 17. I got it because I knew my boyfriend and I were not ready for another child. On top of that from the moment I got my period it was hell. I got my period a month after insertion and ever since then it&039;s been a smooth ride. I haven&039;t had a period since and definitely have not gotten pregnant again. I guess its true when they say everybody takes differently to it. So come February I plan on getting it again for another 5 years. I&039;m one happy customer.','I had my first atrial fibrillation crisis 3 moths ago.

I&039;m pretty happy with these pills','My 6yr old daughter and I have been dealing with this medication for 2yrs now and now that she is off of it and getting ready for the surgery she has been wetting the bed at night and also getting bloody noses is this normal for this medication? I am at a lost here I need to help my baby but idk how doctors are saying that they don&039;t think it&039;s from this medication but I really think it is','I have had my Nexplanon implant in since early 2014. I rarely ever experienced spotting, maybe 2 or 3 times this whole time. Never had a period or pregnancy scare. I am due to have it removed early next year since that will be the 3 year mark.      As of last week I started noticing brown &quot;old blood&quot; after intercourse, not much. By this point I have noticed more blood during intercourse which is off putting at that moment.    I&039;ll be scheduling an appointment with my doctor soon.','I am 25 years old and have been taking this for over 2 years now. 2 years ago I was 145 lbs and now I am 165 and miserable. My husband and I have been dieting and exercising for the past year and half and I have only gained weight, never lost. I finally went to my doctor with the following symptoms: tired all the time even with 10 hours of sleep, mood swing (which effect my relationship), depression, sadness (for no reason), crying out of no where, weight gain and inability to loose weight, bad skin. All of those symptoms are also what people with Thyroid issues have. Well I get my thyroid tested this past week and its normal. I read these reviews and bam I am getting off this immediately and I am really upset I did not read these sooner.','I love Aleve It makes all my lower back pain disappear, I feel like a new person.','Tylenol with codeine 3 does not work for my cough due to bronchitis. I took the meds as prescribed for two weeks. Never worked.','After being suicidal for many months and self harming in addition to extreme anxiety. I had taken Prozac  6 years earlier and didn&039;t work at all has NOW almost eliminated my depression. I feel happier than I have in years. The only downside is I have gained about 20 lbs. My lowest weight was 133, considered healthy for someone 5&039;7 and athletic, but despite my clean eating and exercise I&039;ve blown up to 163 lbs in 2 years and nothing seems to get the weight off. This has been my only negative side effect. I choose my mental health over my body image although I also have an eating disorder BDD.','I&039;ve been on Victoza for 13 days and have lost 8lbs. I&039;ve also been following a low carb diet maintaining 50g of carbs on a daily basis. I&039;ve also worked out only mildly at 2-3 times a week so far.  Feeling great, lots of energy.  Only side effects were nausea the first 2 days and some mild constipation.','This drug had no effect on me except for a very strange taste in my mouth. I stopped taking this after 3 weeks. I was on a low dose. Will go to specialist soon to discuss.','The first day I used it, I felt terribly sick, the following days I didnt even notice I was wearing the patch. I&039;ve been using it fow two years now, it&039;s just wonderful.','This birthcontrol is terrible I am 28 years old was given this since I was diagnosed with PCOS. I took it for 3 weeks and stopped. The 2nd week I was bleeding, bad cramping, and clotting as well...I just assumed it was my body getting used to it after that I got bad bloating to the point that my bladder had pressure on it and I felt the full urgency feeling but did not have a UTI I had horrible depression and anxiety as well ( i am not a anxious or depressed person) It drove me NUTS  I stopped taking it and it took 4 days to get out my system and have me feel back to normal I have some zits now from it as well but that&039;s better than all that other crazy stuff...','My father has started the treatment 2 months ago, and the virus in your blood lowed. However, the sides effects has being terrible. My father feel worse now than before the treatment. He has cognitives problems now, problems to speak, he lost interest in everything. We did a magnetic ressonation in your brain and they found a tumor probably linked to the medicine. My father is transplanted, now we are trying to figure out this, because he cant do the treatment to solve the tumor.','It has worked so far for me and I would recommend it to anyone suffering with depression.','I have only been on this med for two and a half weeks and have already lost eight pounds  Before I started taking Contrave, losing weight was an impossibility.  I am on meds that make me gain weight and I tend to binge eat.  I am now making healthy choices and my portions are half of what they used to be and I feel full.  Sometimes I notice a bad side effect. But the overall effect of this medication has been great  I have less depression and more motivation.  Even my light workouts are better.  I feel so pumped to see what the course of treatment brings  Losing weight for me is priceless.  I have fatty liver disease, high blood pressure and a back injury.  All would be a lot better if I lost weight.  So far so good','This will be my third week on Pristiq 50mg and so far I&039;m feeling quite positive and free of depressive feelings, however that&039;s only if I get a good night&039;s sleep. I have tried one Temazapam which works well but after the third day the build up in my system makes me feel very fatigued. ','Like Celebrex and Vioxx, this caused blood pressure spurts, along with dizziness, weakness, and other side effects. Too dangerous for me to take because of how high it would send my blood pressure within an hour or so of taking it.','Let me just tell you, to those reading these reviews, it&039;s not worth the stress. To sum it up, my bf and I had unprotected sex on Feb 15 but he pulled out and since I forgot bout precum (he claims he doesn&039;t have any) I needed to take the precaution, taking Plan B. He bought the pill and I took it approx 22 hrs after. I had little to no symptoms, first day I had little fatigue and my appetite increased. After so much research, turns out, if you&039;re that 5\% of which it doesn&039;t work on its either because you took it too late or have already taken it before so your body is regulating the pill (that&039;s from what I read) I&039;m a senior in high school and have a lot of plans for my future. My period came today so being a mother is not on the list','I&039;ve had Implanon for a little over a year and nothing but problems and heavy bleeding CONSTANTLY, since the 3rd week it was inserted. Maybe like 20 days all together have been off But I will say one nice thing about it is, that you don&039;t have to remember it each day or ever have to worry about changing it. ','I have been using Mobic to relieve the pain from my Spinal Fusion I had in March/2001. I was previously on Bextra that was discontinued. I find this medication to work just as good as Bextra did.','I also have taken Evoxac for years. I first asked my opthomologist to prescribe pilocarpine.  He would not, telling me to see an ENT physcian for this, as he felt there were to many side effects for this type of drug.   I did get a Rx for the pilocarpine and then switched to Evoxac.  At first I could not perceive a benefit of this drug, but now I can tell when my dose (every eight hours) has worn off. Also, I do not think that I have suffered any side effects from this drug.','This drug is pretty great for depression, however I am on it for serious anxiety and it has only exacerbated it for me. I feel agitated a lot and have insatiable hunger that has caused me to gain a few pounds. There have also been some sexual side effects that have made sex a little more of a challenge.','I called The pharmacy today, because this thing doesn&039;t work. I had a asthma attack and had to use my breathing machine. It needs to be recalled.','No side effects, very light periods. On my 3rd month, and no weight gain. Had a bit of a long period the first month, but since then, it&039;s been perfect. The only gripe I have is that because it&039;s so new, it&039;s crazy expensive. $45 a month even with health insurance.','I was prescribed gabapentin two years ago to help with night sweats, coincidentally I noticed that having always had mild to moderate anxiety I was much calmer and only became anxious as a result of a problem or crisis. recently I had an illness with nausea and loss of appetite, so stopped all my medications for 2 weeks. My anxiety went through the roof with panic attacks almost constantly, I have since found stopping Gabapentin abruptly is a no no, I took one 300mg last night and feel like my old self already, having had a nights sleep, after 2 weeks of insomnia. I think Gabapentin works extremely well, and I have no side effects. I hope my Dr doesn&039;t ever want me to stop taking them, but if he does I now know it has to be a gradual process.','This is the best migraine medication for me.  I feel these are very different for each individual.  But this has been the most successful at completely aborting my migraines most of the time. With other types I have had to take a repeat dose to get the results needed to continue a normal day.','I have had severe depression since my teens and have been on antidepressants for many years. Fortunately I have had beneficial effects from several over the years.  The most effective treatment to date has been a combination of Wellbutrin and Cymbalta. I took that combination for ten+ years and unfortunately I recently started slipping downward, increased depression and feeling out of control.  I  was prescribed Fetzima (transitioned off Cymbalta) and completed the starter pack with the only benefit being increased energy. My Dr then increased the doseage to 80mg and have been at 80mg for two + weeks.  I have never felt (for lack of a better word) so crazy in my life I have been so irretiable, angry, depressed and unreasonable and feeling','I took Yaz for a little over 2 years.  From around the age of 16 to 18.  I gained a little bit of weight, not much but EXTREMELY hard to lose.  Also, I experienced mood swings frequently.  Sometimes getting extremely upset and feeling the need to cry.  But the reason I stopped taking Yaz was because I started to get EXTREMELY BAD migraines/headaches.  These headaches would come VERY frequently.  I would say averaging around 2-5 days a week.  MIgraines run in my family but funny thing is I never experienced them before the pill.  Also, nothing would help these headaches.  I took everything from Tylenol to Excedrin Migraine.  Nothing helped.  Hoped this helped good luck','I found out I had genital hsv 1 about a month ago. I have never seen a sore or bump of any kind down there, but experienced a burning that I compared to being cut, literally. The doctor found a lesion by the vaginal opening, that looked like little paper cuts apparently. Anyhow the 500 mg Valtrex 1&times; daily started helping after 2 weeks. The weird nerve-like sensations I was experiencing were all gone after 3 weeks. The only negative side effect is fatigue after I take the dose.','This has been the most wonderful medicine for my 2 abscessed teeth. Yes both hit me at one time and it was very very painful and within 36 hours of taking it I could see a big difference such as less pain and decreased swelling. This is day 6 and I have no pain and no swelling.','It helps me from pulling my hair out but I still have anxiety.','I had unprotected sex and he ejaculated completely inside me. About 38 hours later, I took the pill with food and water. I was expecting my period about a week from that day. Throughout the whole time waiting for my period I had absolutely zero side affects, and it really really worried me. It was about 2 weeks after I took it that I finally got my period, and I was never so happy to be in so much pain.','Did help relieve some of the pain temporarily. Worth using it at night to help relieve pain to be able to sleep.','Awful I put in the one time treatment around 11:15pm and I&039;m up at 1am with the most intense itching/burning sensation of my life I bought it because the antibiotic I&039;m taking gave me a YI but this is completely terrible I want to scratch my vag off. NEVER again.','I didn&039;t like my lips looking like sandpaper for 5 months of my life, but otherwise it worked.','This worked great for my back pain and is non-narcotic so I don&039;t feel woozy.','I have been on Vyvanse for almost 2 years and have had no major symptoms. I had dry mouth, but that pretty much subsided. I did lose about 30lbs, but I&039;m 5&039;9&quot; and was weighing about 240lbs, so it wasn&039;t as bad thing. I have ADHD, I started this medicine when I was almost 40. I&039;m almost 42 and really have had a great experience. My son is on it for ADD, and my daughter for ADHD. She was just tested and accepted into the gifted program and he is 2 years younger and has had significant improvements to his grades and behavior. I would recommend.','I have only been on Victoza for less than a week now and already huge difference in my levels. Prior to Victoza I was on 2000mg Metforming, 5mg Onglyza following a low carb diet. That brought my levels down to an average of about 14 while fasting. Since being on the Victoza the highest reading I have had so far is a 12.5 which for me is incredible I can&039;t wait to see what I will be at over the next month.  I am not focusing on the weight loss at the moment if it happens awesome, but I&039;m most concerned about my sugars. As for side effects I have had very mild nausea and that&039;s all.','Day 2. Taking for major anxiety/ slight depression. 10mg daily. Anxiety is lifting and feel much more in control and calm. Only side symptom is a slight wheezy/ tired feeling. I took it last night about 9pm and was asleep by 11pm. First time in a year that a fell asleep without racing thoughts and worries.','I have a spinal cord injury. I&039;m 7 years in this year. The only thing I feel below my waist is nerve pain, its really bad in my feet. If it wasn&039;t for the Neurontin and taking Cymbalta together I wouldn&039;t be able to function because of the nerve pain. It does help but for me I cant take the generic gabapentin.','My Dr agreed to over see putting me on Qsymia because he watched as I devotedly pursued everything else to no avail. I have now been on this for 1 week and have dropped 3 lbs. I have 60 to go and have all the patience in the world as long as I see progress. I do get tired midday laydown, ten minutes get up, I do get constipated but take those probiotic gummies that seem to help. I crave sweet but nothing really sounds good. I plan to start walking just a mile daily.','At 59 years of age have been suffering migraines since I was 21. Think I have tried every medication available in the UK. Maxalt is the only thing that has ever worked for me.Pain usually gone after 20 minutes, before I took Maxalt I could be in bed for 2 days rolling around in agony. Only side effects are tiredness and strangely It makes me sneeze just once as soon as I have taken it. Maxalt has completely changed my life. Fortunate to live in UK as I get it free on national health prescription.','Started this last night. I have zero appetite. How is this possible? I love food, but I don&039;t really feel like eating. All I&039;ve had today is some grapes. I have a sandwich in my lunchbox, but I don&039;t have any appetite. I haven&039;t had any of the side effects so far. I started with the 1.2 dose. The &quot;pen&quot; is really easy to use compared to my intramuscular testosterone. However, this drug is ridiculously expensive. Even with good insurance, I would have to pay almost $400 a MONTH Fortunately, another serious illness pushed me over my out-of-pocket annual. So, I filled the script for $0. Due to politics I may have no insurance next year. Anyway, so far, so good with Victoza.','Leg pain was terrible.  Lyrica almost solved my pain issue.  I take 100Mg twice a day, it is wonderful.','I had a wonderful experience with Ziana. This is the only acne medication that didn&039;t dry out my skin after using it. I thought I would never have a good experience with acne medications. Ziana is a smooth, moisturizing acne medication that leaves your skin feeling great. With a couple days the redness and swelling of my acne went down significantly. I don&039;t see myself ever using another acne medication.','I have been taking 50mg of Pristiq for about 5 weeks now, and just started taking 100 mg a couple days ago. I am 31 yrs old, but have been on antidepressants for 10 yrs. I&039;ve tried many SSRI&039;s (Lexapro for several yrs) and never felt much better at all. I remained depressed and began to try to accept that this is just what my life would be. Finally, about 2 months ago my Drs office began doing genetic testing which can guide them on what medicines your body will respond best to. So Pristiq it was. I think my mood has lifted somewhat. I&039;m really hoping it will improve even more as studies show full benefits take 6-8 weeks. ','Butt paste was very useful for my baby. She had diaper rash 4 times. I tried lots of variety (Destin , A D , nystatin, neosporin) but none worked. I tried Butt paste its really very good. ','I&039;ve been on Viibryd (40mg) for a few months now, for major depression/anxiety. Before that, I took Prozac, but I felt like it had stopped working. The Viibryd is working well for me. I have more good days. I don&039;t feel sedated, just more positive and functional. As far as side effects, I get an upset stomach if I don&039;t eat before I take it. I took it right before bed one time and had a really vivid nightmare, so I try to take it early in the day. When I do miss a dose, I feel withdrawal more than I did with Prozac. Overall, it&039;s effective for me, but I have to be more careful to avoid side effects.','I have only been on this for 2 weeks but I can seriously notice a difference. I am 21 and for about 6 years (after a traumatic event) I have been suffering from &quot;severe depression&quot;. I have always had pain and always been to tired to do anything but lay in bed and cry I can now say I am happy Finally happy, I can&039;t remember a time I was ever like this. I am motivated, active, and enjoying life. It works quick. I do however have mild headaches everyday and multiple nightmares every night. I am told these will subside. It&039;s pricey but I really think its worth it Good luck to everyone.','Been taking Zoloft for 2 weeks and 3 days for panic attacks and general anxiety disorder. 2 weeks in I felt like myself again, careless towards things that didn&039;t matter and was able to go to work and be more social. For 3 days now I&039;ve felt strange, had a panic attack though on day 14 and I think that might be why (can&039;t get over them sometimes). I can&039;t wait for a month to be over with so I&039;ll get the full effect of Zoloft. Hopefully I&039;ll be back to normal soon.','I am very happy taking Zanaflex.  I was originally put on it for migraines but after a major car accident they tried to put me on Soma which caused some side effects.  I went back to Zanaflex and have never looked back.','Never has any side effects. Thanks to the drug one year later still free of it all','This helps me concentrate more.','No side effects, many more plus/up days than before.  Seems the longer I am on the Deplin in conjunction with my antidepressant, the better my moods and overall feeling gets.','Took this pill for 1.) Acne and 2.) Birth Control.  I have had a side effect that very few people had which was hair loss in the scalp.  Big amounts of hair would come out when I would shower.  I realized this happened to me with a previous birth control as well but want to note for others as a precaution.  I got extremely bloated on this medication.  I have a flat tummy and it looked like I was pregnant which was painful and annoying.  This also gave me a very backed up system which I never get.  I got extremely nauseous, very moody, heartburn, anxiety and some depression.  The only pro was that my breasts grew a cup size.  Can&039;t complain about that I&039;ve been off of this pill for three days and all of these symptoms are gone.','This has been a great medication and has made me feel much better.  If you take too much at one time it can upset your stomach. ','I went on this last year for PMDD, like severe PMS, and did fine the first 6 months. I&039;m not sure why, but suddenly my periods are 2 weeks long instead of one. I&039;m also having the same severity, if not more, of cramps that I had before I started. I think the issue was that I might have already had estrogen dominance, and the lack of ovulation made it even worse. (No ovulation means no progesterone to help your periods be lighter.) Also I have zero sex drive. Seriously, doing dishes has been more appealing lately. It has made my mood issues improve, though. I don&039;t feel nearly as depressed as I did before taking it.','I just finished my first pack two days ago and I will not be taking it again. In the beginning I was fine. There were no symptoms and I was feeling good. Now that it&039;s been a month I can tell you I&039;m in a place I don&039;t recognize. Every little thing my boyfriend does I get upset over, I&039;m constantly crying and paranoid, never want to get out of bed and I&039;m depressed. This is miserable, and I&039;m hoping that within the next few days I&039;ll feel normal again after being off of this.','I have struggled with ADD since I was in grade school. Although diagnosed, my mother was not about putting me on medication. That being said I struggled really bad until I graduated. I am now 22 &amp; have been out on almost any ADD/ADHD medication you can think of. To keep it short &amp; sweet, Concerta &amp; focalin worked for about an hour then I turned into a horrible person to be around - extreme mood swings, aggression, agitation, really easily annoyed, &amp; hostile. My doctor decided to put me on Adderall XR 10mg tablets &amp; let me tell you it has saved my life It lasts all day for me, I am more focused, my heart rate doesn&039;t jump to extremes like it did on Focalin. It actually makes me more relaxed &amp; enjoyable to be around. 10/10','I have had Liletta for a year now. Insertion was bad but nothing I couldn&039;t handle since I was used to awful cramps. Since then I&039;ve remained around the same weight, my skin has stayed clear, and I have a much lighter period then I used to. Only negatives I&039;ve had are random spotting which I&039;ve had on previous birth controls as well. I highly recommend Liletta','This stuff is terrible. Burns. Badly. Thought I could wait it out- spent two hours in bed reading reviews which made me feel better but I should be sleeping. Going to try to push it out and probably spend the night with an ice pack between my legs......asking for Diflucan tomorrow because this is just not worth it. More expensive too. All around just bad. DONT USE IT IF YOU HAVET YET','I was on Bydureon for about 2 months, I really noticed the loss of appetite and lost my sweet tooth. My weight came down and my blood sugar levels dropped from 8.5 to 6.0. I was really happy with the medicine until the known side effects started to show. They were nausea this happened approx once a week in the fourth week in on taking the medicine and bloating, indigestion, a lot of passing wind and acidy burps. Also I felt a bump and itchy feeling around injection area whenever I injected. If they can sort out these side effects then it would be really fantastic for people with Type 2 diabetes. I was really reluctant to stop but the horrible nausea beat me.  ','I took it (2 a day) for a few weeks for a compression fracture and it helped not only that but the constant arthritis in the lower back. I also took it some years ago, knowing only the generic name and not associating it with &039;Vicodin&039;, for shingles. Nothing short of heroin can eliminate shingles pain, but this did a pretty good job without any sign of physical dependence. I will request a continuing prescription just for the arthritis.','I have OCD, anxiety, and ADHD. I also pick my cuticles everyday. The official name is Dermatillomania and it&039;s closely related to pulling hair out. I&039;ve been picking my cuticles for 25 years. There has never been a time when I did not pick them to some degree. I try to hide them and I frequently make them bleed. I take 450 mg of Wellbutrin XL and 25 mg of Paxil (by cutting the pills) daily.   I started the Paxil almost a month ago for anxiety. While it has helped a lot with anxiety, it&039;s even more incredible to me that my cuticles are now almost perfect with just one tiny blemish and my nails are long. This is the ONLY time they&039;ve looked like this since I started when I was 9 years old. Very, very pleased No more hiding my fingers','For years I had battled with IBS D, until being prescribed Effexor XR. I did have problems when changed to the generic. If I missed a dose of the name brand I could take the next dose. On the generic if I missed I would have awful withdrawals. And one manufacturer Zydus 120 mg lasted only 12 hours. I found manufacturer Greenstone will last the 24 hours. My current pharmacy makes sure they have it available, but some pharmacys aren&039;t able to get certain manufacturers. I have been able to live a normal life with the medication Effexor XR or generic by Greenstone. I do not have IBS D, nor the stress and anxiety of never knowing when it would hit. I am very thankful.','I tried the samples my dr sent me home with. It gave me some of the worst stomach aches of my life. And I didn&039;t go to the bathroom anymore than I normally do. I hated this medication, it made me feel much worse.','I only took Bontril 105mg for 2 months. I started out at 250lbs I went to buy New clothes and was in a size 18, so depressing I started out on Bontril 35mg, that did nothing for me so they bumped it up. I did stop drinking cold drinks, and only water. I did not even drink tea. I ate a high protein diet, beef jerky, cheese, and yogurt. They told me 1200 calories but that felt impossible I did exercise the first month but slacked in the second. I lost 50 pounds total in those 2 months.  There after I did not gain my appetite back and got all the way down to 162 pounds. This medicine is absolutely amazing Its been over 2 years and I just starting gaining some of the weight back due to the depo shot, I will definalty be going back to Bont','Diagnosed- generalized juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Completely stopped my sons seizures, he is only 14 years old.','Thyroid supplements are really hard on my stomach &amp; I couldn&rsquo;t take them for long. I found out most have lactose in them; Levothroid does not. If you&rsquo;re lactose intolerant or have digestive problems, I would highly recommend trying Levothroid. Going on 6 years now and no ill effects.','Previously on generic with onset symptoms. Now on Name brand and still transitioning from Aptiom which was not effective in controlling symptoms. Hoping name brand works.','I started taking the doxcy (100 mg) once a day for my acne.  I am 29 years old female that had never had acne in my teens until now at this age.  Okay so I began with this pill and for me it got worse before it got better. I took this for a month and a week and I did see improvement till like my 4th week of using it. So then my derm prescribed the same doxcy  (100 mg) but now twice a day which is much better along with tretinoin cream 0.05\% every night. This has helped me so much. One big tip that I can give you guys is not to stress about the acne I know it&039;s hard but stressing will only make it worse. Just think that one day it will go away.  Now it&039;s been  25 days with the new prescribed doxcy and finally no more acne.','I just started Adipex-P 37.5mg on March 6th, 2011. I am in the military and am a single mom of two. I work and go to school full time so its hard for me to work out everyday even though I&039;m supposed to. I have never really had trouble losing weight until I started working night shift in May. I would only eat one meal a day but since it was late I gained the weight. I am 5&039;5 and weighed 184lbs before I was put on this pill. The first day I took it was right after the doctors appointment. By 5pm and I had only eaten one piece of ham. I bought a salad after I took the pill and tried to eat it when I got home at 6 and couldn&039;t because I had no urge to want to eat. It&039;s Wednesday now and I&039;ve lost 4lbs already.','Within 2 weeks saw blood glucose more than half to good levels I&039;ve not seen for years (literally) no major side effects - felt sick twice within a day or two of first dose but apart from that all ok. Injecting in fatty tissue of stomach hardly any pain. Very well designed device and needle almost painless. I would recommend this for T2s who have gone to max on oral meds and need that extra help, this really is the magic bullet for me. I can handle weekly injections but not daily that&039;s too much imho.','I took this for five months and lost 35 pounds. I loved it but had to stop because it wasn&039;t covered by my insurance and I could no longer handle the $60 a month for it Would definitely love to know which medication in this pill is what suppressed my appetite so I could take that alone Would so take this again if I could afford it','Quickest relief ever  Antibiotics always give me a yeast infection Vaginal creams are slow and yucky. Fluconazole worked quickly and completely','It was like going to sleep when you were a little kid and you were very tired and your bed felt delicious.','I stated taking Contrave a week ago I lost 7lbs so far. I don&rsquo;t feel hungry but I eat about 3X a day low carb some protein and fiber. I drink plenty of water. I sometimes feel nauseous. I don&rsquo;t like to take medications but I am trying to continue taking it because it seems like it&rsquo;s working. After reading some of the reviews I am more confident about it now. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about major side effects with Contrave but no one has reported any so far. Good luck everyone in this weight loss journey.','I have been a type 2 diabetic for 10 yrs now. I tried victoza in may 2016. As of today, Sept. 24th I have lost 45 pounds, I&039;m down to 1 metformin a day and my A1C is great The side effects are minimal. Mainly sour stomach but that can be controlled mostly by diet.  Low starch foods help alot. I&039;m so glad after trying a few newer meds that I found victoza','Frustrated with the lack of effectiveness of any of the medications I have been given for this condition - including Elidel. Still experiencing extreme itchiness, oozing, peeling and cracked skin. Over the years more areas of my body is affected with this condition. Painful and unsightly.','This med helps to take the edge off enough for the pain to be tolerable. I take HCL 15 mg one every 6 hours. Compared to hydrocodone this is much better and faster relief. Just be careful what you take with it.','I&039;ve been on birth control for a while now due to horrendous cramps and excessively heavy cycles. And I&039;ve always been an anti-kid-having lady so hey it works for me. So I ended up switching from the nuva ring (which I loved) to the Mirena. I&039;m not going to complain about pain because we&039;re all different and to be honest, it really wasn&039;t terrible, a little discomfort. But I&039;ve had my Mirena for a little over 2 years now and I&039;ve gained 40-50 pounds with no change in diet, I have absolutely no energy for anything (I work and go to school full time), and I&039;m recently married with no sex drive. At first the Mirena was a God send, no period, no pill, no hassle or worries. But now I&039;m counting down the days this evil thing is gone.','I used Monistat 7 day and so far its ok. At first it feels a little uncomfortable but after about 15-20 minutes it goes away. I&039;ve seen everyone had bad results with the one day and three day... Maybe because they are stronger than the seven days. I hope the seven days works good... Today is my first day using it. Just wish the applicator was a little more comfortable','I started taking this bc pill a month and week ago. At first I just got nauseous then I started getting migraines which were intense and the depression was horrible I was so emotional over stupid things.I got my second pack and took it at 7pm woke up at 8am and felt fine but around 12 I felt bad .I was so weak I couldn&039;t move and I was sweating and cold and my arm went numb and it felt like I had a hang over but worse. my eyes hurt also. I am getting off this pill and getting switched to a different kind. This was the first bc pill I&039;ve ever used.','This has really helped me. I have had RLS all my life off and on.  The RLS is worse now,  I am 74yrs.  I have been on it almost a year. I believe I may be getting some side effects lately. I am so tired, and can&039;t seem to think straight sometimes. I realize that could be from other things, but I am going to talk to my Doctor on next visit. It is a God send if you haven&039;t slept for nights.','First of all, I started taking birth control when I was 17. I started to regulate and lighten my period. I took Yaz for a year. No problems. After I turned 18, my insurance dropped me so I went to a women&039;s clinic and was given six months of the Ortho. I have been taking it for four months now, and once this pack is gone, I&039;m done. The side effects are HORRIBLE. I have no drive for sex. I&039;m moody, I cry constantly. My period is heavy and unpredictable. It also lasts forever. I haven&039;t gotten pregnant (we use condoms as well though), but that&039;s the only plus. My relationship is at stake here because of a pill.','I am 69 years old.  Prior to starting  5 pumps daily of Andro Gel 5 months ago, T level was 207, low energy and almost no sex drive plus often could not maintain an erection.  After only a couple of weeks, there was a big turnaround, good erections and libido what it was at age 40. Did notice I was a bit more aggressive.  Then, about the 3rd month things went downhill with things back pretty much as they were before Andro Gel. Presently awaiting results of test to see where T levels stands.','Face cleared. Gained 5 pounds. No vomiting for me or irregular mood swings. Also my periods are very very precise. Only bad thing is the super decreased limbo. Just don&039;t care for it anymore it seems','All the side effects','Slow and steady definitely wins this race. I was skeptical going on birth control to fix my ongoing acne battle especially since I am not sexually active.     I have been on it for 3 months now and I am so grateful I did this My acne has cleared up 80\% and I expect it to be closer to 95\% for the next pack. It was hard to be patient those 3 months of wondering if it would work, but it did and I&039;m soo happy about it.     At first, I noticed some swelling and tenderness in the chest, but that subsided after about 2-3 weeks, once my body got a bit more used to it. I had a few pounds of weight gain but that has since come off too- and may have been just water weight.','Although I think I might have kidney stones instead of a UTI, (due to vast amounts of blood in my urine and no pain when I urinate) my only side effect is nausea. I can&039;t say if it actually helped with symptoms because I still have side and belly pain after 7 days of being on it. Just because one person might have one side effect or allergic reaction doesn&039;t mean the next person will. Everyone&039;s body is different and what doesn&039;t work for one person might work for the other.','I&039;ve been taking metronidazoles for 4 days (3 a day) and I&039;m still in agony, I&039;ve tried so many painkillers and nothing helps, my right side of my face is in agony and I can&039;t eat or drink anything hot or too cold, cold air hurts my gums also, anyone have any advice?','This was the worst experience I&039;ve had with a medication. I had to go off Lithium because it gave me hypothyroidism and diabetes insipidus and Geodon was a replacement. I was given Geodon at the lowest dose for about two weeks. I was okay, but experiencing a bit of random anxiety. Then my dose was upped and I had a panic attack (I&039;ve only had 3 of those in my life before) within 24hrs. Several days later I was in the ER with suicidal thoughts for the first time in 20 years. As far as general effectiveness goes before the dosage increase sent everything haywire, I got depressed right away once totally off the Lithium, so it wasn&039;t really helping anyway. The suicidal thoughts and anxiety were gone within 48hrs after I stopped taking it.','I have been suffering from terrible allergies due to hay fever.  The allergies caused horrible headaches.  Doctor gave me a prescription for butalbital (Fioricet). It helped so much. I was taking Excedrin migraine however it was keeping me up at night. Everyone who suffers must try it. It is inexpensive compared to most migraine medications.','One thing I&039;ve learned is to avoid dairy products and too much fat about a week to 10 days before my period. I helps a lot with reducing bloating and cramps. I still have to use medication to control the cramps, but no dairy makes a huge difference.','I can&039;t rate this a 10 because it is DEFINITELY not perfect. No birth control method is. However, I enjoy being on it. What I like about Depo Provera is that it&039;s a shot I have to get every 3 months - it&039;s GREAT not having to worry about birth control in-between shots. I don&039;t have to swallow or insert anything or worry about not taking it on time.  For me, it also stops periods which is the number 2 reason I love it, the number 1 reason being that it&039;s very effective at preventing pregnancy.    I got my first Depo Provera shot when I was 14 to stop periods.  I kept bleeding and spotting and was told that would eventually go away by the 2&039;nd or 3&039;rd shot.  That didn&039;t bother me.  ','I was diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia after months of falling asleep during the day and very early at night.  It very much affects my life, making me feel overwhelmed and unable to complete what a normal person should be able to do.  I was put on Nuvigil and a few hours after taking the first pill, I began to feel jittery.  It lasted a couple of hours and as that feeling left, I got migraines.  The migraines lasted for 2 days.  I then had 2 days where I felt absolutely awesome - I slept fine at night and had ample energy to get through my day. The next 2 days, I felt tired and dragging again.  The last day, I was tired, depressed, and crying on and off all day.  I am now off the medication.','Avelox did promptly clear up bronchitis and sinusitis. My ankles were so swollen that I could only wear loose fitting houseshoes for the 10 day treatment time. It made me feel jittery and caused abdominal cramps. ','Best pain medication I have been on. Started because it was one of the cheapest and long acting. The only major problem is that it destroyed my teeth. It does not make me feel high just normal, it is however a very difficult medication to stop taking. I would not give up my methadone for any other treatment, especially suboxone.','I LOVE Celebrex  I have degenerative disk disease, bulged disk and degenerative hips.  My doctor had me try it after learning how I can tolerate 6 ibupropen a day.  I have been 85\% better as far as the daily pain.  I can do things in exercise that I could not before, due to the pain.  I take homeopathic anti inflammatory supplements as well.  I am a 43 year old photographer, pilates student and teacher living in pain for over 6 years.  So wonderful to have this relief.','This drug is phenomenal for migraines as long as you catch it early.','I was prescribed this for headaches and eye irritation for allergies.  Been  taking it for a month.  No improvement or change in symptoms.  Drs office said it takes a few days to help symptoms ; pharmacist said it can take 4-6  weeks to build up on in your system.  The generic is cheap but after a month,  no change.  Don&039;t know if its med not working or mis diagnosis','It has the most disgusting taste it made me sick. Retail price over $900.00 and I threw it away.','28 years old, 165 pounds. Severe paranoia from stimulants and Wellbutrin; caffeine as well. Nowhere else to turn, I started on Straterra 10mg, twice a day. Effects in first 2 hours. Felt manic-ish. Sleep pattern disrupted. Cola colored urine stains on the toilet bowl when not flushed. Smoking desire enhanced.  2 weeks later. same dosage. Very focused. Used together occasionally with an anti-psychotic and anti-anxiety for when any panic attacks, manicness, or paranoia begins to occur.   Studying time increased. Comprehension enhanced. Distractions minimized. Recommend this medicine at 10mg for those with side effects from stimulants.','Okay so I&039;ve had pneumonia (Viral) and now I&039;m left with post viral bacterial bronchitis infection. I&039;ve been given Doxycycline (Sandoz) tablets and have only taken six tablets. Now my doctor also notice that I also have quiet severe acne and scaring. He explained about the medicine and said if my skin starts clearing up let him know and I can get more. My experience so far is amazing only reason why it&039;s one off from 10/10 is because I did break out in the first 3 days and it brought up an ugly big pimple that has left me bruised. 3 days later almost gone. My face is not sore as it was before. On top of it I do have a daily routine (sometimes). I take Bio Zinic tablets, deep cleanser (Niva) and Real-U (cream) on affected areas. I clean my face 4 days a week.','I&039;ve taken a lot of medications. I was prescribed latuda and it wasnt a very good experience. I couldn&039;t even sit down to watch a movie without feeling jittery and needing to be on the go. When it was bed time my legs were so restless I couldn&039;t sleep. I would lay in bed kicking my legs non stop. I&039;ll never take this again.','I have been on anastozole for a year and half, was on tamoxifen for a year before but now gone through menopause. I was a fit 41 year old before, I always have  horrible taste in mouth, struggle to get up to walk especially from out of bed, my joints are so painful, I struggle to grip, lost the steering wheel the other week and nearly shot off road, fuzzy head, hot sweats, think I&039;ve made the decision to come off it and hope for the best.','Before starting Linzess at age 21 (~1 yr ago), I was going to the bathroom about once every 3 weeks. Eventually, laxatives were necessary but still I was going maybe 3 times a month. I was experiencing severe stomach pains that left me in bed for hours at a time daily, eventually I ended up in the ER.    Within 24 hours of starting Linzess, I went to the bathroom. Yes, the first few days it was diarrhea. Within the first week, I was having regular bowel movements and have been having about 1/day since then. MY STOMACH PAIN HAS DISAPPEARED (that&039;s huge)     Gas? Yes, all the time. Diarrhea? Only if I take it too late in the day. Increased hunger? Yes, obviously, because my stomach is empty. Worth it? 5 billion percent.','I will personally attest to this,,, 33 years ago, as a teenager, I came home from school one day with a terrible sore throat - I squirted quite a bit of Chloraseptic into my throat and swallowed more than I should have. Within hours, I fell into, what I have described all these years later, as a coma-like state of awareness for a good majority of the rest of that week.  I finally began to come out of that state 5 days later.  It was never discussed with any doctor, so I just chalked it up to some freak of nature.    I am, without a doubt, now assured the phenol ingredient was the cause to my negative reaction to swallowing  the Chloraseptic','I have been on Nexplanon for about a year and a half now. I decided to go with this form of BC because I am so forgetful that the pill was just not an option for me. This has honestly been one of the most frustrating experiences I have ever had. When I first got it inserted in my arm I noticed I had my period practically everyday and this went on for about 3 months until I went back to my  gynecologist and she said it was completely normal and that it should stop. Well it hasn&039;t at all. Everyday I have spotting and it&039;s gotten to the point where I have to wear a tampon every day . Every time I have sex there is always blood everywhere. And it&039;s hard explaining why I am always on my period to my partner and it&039;s made me self conscious.','Prescribed via a Psychiatrist for severe Panic attacks for 2 years. If I take dosage late or forget to take it the withdrawal symptoms kick in.   Gnawing physical pain, breathlessness, disorientation to time, difficulties in word finding while speaking, severe muscle pain and stiffness, nausea, labile emotions and panic.  ','I had been putting off colonoscopy for years due to fear of prep, despite the fact my mother had colon cancer when she was 48 I am 48 now and couldn&039;t put it off any longer. I have to say Suprep was great Follow doctor/kit instructions exactly. Works within 30-45 min after dosing. Done using bathroom within 3-3 1/2 hours. Tips: Eat lightly 2 or so days prior, eating mainly soft foods. Hydrate yourself several days prior also, making sure to get lots of extra fluids/electrolytes. Don&039;t drink too much right before dosing so that you can get all the solution/water down comfortably. Do drink as much fluid as you can in between doses to stay hydrated. And RELAX Positive attitude goes along way I would definitely use this product again.','I have been on the duragesic patches 100mcg every 2 days a little over 3 years for chronic pain due to a failed lumbar fusion surgery. Before going on the patch I was taking 10-15 loritab&039;s a day , which tore my gastrointestinal system apart.  These patches were a Godsend. with norco as a break through med.  I usually only have to take if I get a little over active . The only reason I didn&039;t rate a 10 was a few side effects sweats and constipation being the worse. gains beat that easy.','Suffered from anxiety and depression for 3 months with over 20 side effects. Took citalopram and Prozac but both only worsened my side effects. Finally doctor gave me mirtazapine and almost overnight I seemed to improve. Had my first full sleep in 3 months and felt like eating again. Slowly over the course of 1 week all side effects left me and within 2 weeks I was more or less off the medicine. 3 months later I lead my old life again. If you suffer from sleep and have lost your appetite due to anxiety give this a go. Good luck','I&039;ve been tormented by anxiety since childhood. I am 24 years old and have been through a lot in my life. I&039;ve been diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety, panic attacks, ADD. I&039;ve been medicated most my life as well. My anxiety got so bad in high school that I had to be home schooled. I wake up in the morning feeling like my heart will explode for no apparent reason. I get intense irrational fear and intense impulses to harm myself because I just can&039;t take it and get frustrated I start throwing and breaking things I can&039;t stand to be alone a lot of the time. Xanax works fast and calms me down without knocking me out. Depending on the severity of my attacks I take up to 2 mg. No less than 0.5-1mg.','Worked for 2 weeks then stopped.','Ok girls if your reading this it&039;s because you are scared because u think ur pregnant and don&039;t understand plan b I sadly am 15 and had unprotected sex with my bf. I am on birth control but being stupid I was still scared even tho he didn&039;t cum inside of me so I took plan b anyways the week after I had sex again unprotected but this time he cummed inside and that scared me so even tho I am on birth control I took plan b about 30 hours later I have had awful side affects dizziness, being nauseous and headaches have been killing me for about a week now I was supposed to get my period last night during the night and I didn&039;t so I started getting really scared but tonight I finally got it and it was a big relief Plan b works don&039;t worry','Stopped the symptoms (heartburn and reflux) immediately and completely. No side effects. For me, a wonder pill.','Started taking Saxenda on April 18th and have had only a few side effects. I have some nausea and a headache in the evenings. I&039;m hoping this subsides the longer I&039;ve been on it. I have lost 6 lbs which is an amazing accomplishment for me. I have not been able to loose more than 2 lbs no matter what diet I&039;ve tried. I get full very fast, only eating about 1/2 what I used to eat at each meal. Sleeping great but am experiencing a great deal of fatigue especially late afternoon and evening. Will continue on and hope this weight loss continues. The doctor gave me a month of samples so I didn&039;t waste money if it didn&039;t agree with me.','This medication is brilliant.  Completely got rid of my depression and social phobia. I take 75mg/day.  The SSRI&039;s didn&039;t really work.  Was laying on the bed all day thinking of suicide and death.  After I started Nardil my life completely changed.  Thank goodness for the medication.','The medication helped my pain and did not increase my appetite. But I ended up in the hospital with 75\% of the side effects including irregular heart rate and low potassium levels. ','I&039;m 65, female and last night I took my first pill.  I&039;ve had Hep C since about 1975.  I looked at that pill a long time before I took it.  It seems too good to be true and I&039;m afraid of the side effects.  Still this morning I still feel the same as ever.  It would be nice if it just continued this way.  I will make it through this treatment and I will get cured.','After breaking my neck and back in a car accident I was given 2 40 mg Oxycontin and 6 5mg oxycodone IR per day. Over a period of 12 months the effectiveness decreased. Introduced to Opana, they worked 10x better without having the euphoric feeling (major for me). Due to cost, I switched from Opana ER 2x40mg. per day to the generic oxymorphone 3x30mg. per day. Although generic does not last as long as the Opana brand, taking 3 X per day (every 8 hours) works very well. Rarely do I have the level of pain I used to while taking other medicines. If I could take every 6 I do not think I would need to take as many IR pills as I do.','It doesn&039;t work for me. I have been on 6mg a day for four months (one 4mg and one 2mg patches). My testosterone was slightly above 100 before the patches and today is 11. That&039;s right 11.','I don&039;t get headaches very often, but when I do they are bad. I take Excedrin, and it is gone in 20 minutes. ','I had brachytherapy and it  helps me pee a much heavier stream but I still feel like I have to pee all the time.  When does it end?','I was very very bad at one point with my anxieyy and depression and the OCD, they were all working together against me, the horrible disgusting thoughts from the OCD was driving me into constant panic attacks and anxiety through the roof Which drove me to stay in doors and avoid triggers which then pushed me into a deep deep depression, I&039;ve been on zoloft now for about 6 months on a low dose of of 50mg, and I feel much better I was able to go out and get a job which I am excelling at and got three raises in 4 months I have felt a bit of the anxiety and ocd poking out once in a while but I may need to raise the dose but over all this med had changed my life so far, if you are in a rut and are down don&039;t give up you can regain your life back','I am allergic to most antibiotics, including Amoxicillin and Erythromycin. Upon reaching my 8th month of pregnancy, my family all came down with bronchitis and unfortunately I caught it as well .. the doctors prescribed me the Z Pack and within 24 hours I felt tremendously better, which says a lot, considering I was in so much pain I could hardly even function. It took away the body aches, the hot/cold sweats, the fever, and suppressed my coughing. Of the few antibiotics I&039;m able, the Z Pack always has and will be my first choice - it never ceases to amaze me at how quickly and effectively it works My whole family swears by it. Highly recommended, 10/10, and two thumbs up. The occasional side effect is worth it','Had a large pedunctulated fibroid tumor on my uterus- shot was administered , they found my fibroid got larger after 3 months. Had to have a partial hysterectomy to have it removed so I could sit, drive and have sex without being uncomfortable or bleeding.  I had every side effect which was miserable. I had extreme hair loss (thinning) and I&039;m still trying to grow it back... this drug did not work for me. It has been over a year.','I&039;m 35 years old with 4 kids. I got aubra birth control pills from planned parenthood. The first week was fantastic but on my second week, I noticed some acne or rashes on my forehead. By the end of the second week, it spread all over my FACE and CHEST','After trying the patch, ring, and several pills I was recommended Levora by my doctor. It made my flow lighter and period shorter. I am sensitive to different birth control and the doctor said it is probably the additives. I went to planned parenthood for Levora but they do not carry that exact brand. This time they gave me Chateal to try. If you are having a problem with pills from the clinic it can be because of the additives, sometimes it is worth paying the $20 for name brands at the pharmacy. You can get a discount card to make it less expensive. I am worried to try another brand at this point.','9 months in: The first period that I had on Implanon was about 2 wks later than expected and lasted about 2 wks long. Since then all of my periods have come within about a wk of when I would have expected them. Each period has been shorter in length, as well as lighter. (Usually there are only about 2 days of bleeding that are really noticeable but the other 5-8 days are just spotting on and off). I look forward to the day when it is just a few days of spotting, or less. As far as other side effects go: I have maybe one bad headache every other month. I noticed no weight gain until recently (which is probably due more so to the holidays than the Implanon). I do have a lot of acne, especially on my chest. Despite these negatives, I like it','This is the only medication that help me.  When I don&039;t take it, I can definitely tell.  I just wish it was covered by my insurance.  The cost is ridiculous','Had the IUD inserted on 08/01/2016 in August, no cramps initially but About 2 hours after the insertion i started feeling cramping but nothing Advil and a warm towel didnt help with.  My periods before the IUD were a maximum of 2 days and VERY light. With the IUD, my periods are 4 days long with Heavy bleeding on day 2 and 3, but a SUPER tampon and a pad could help you with that. Overall i am satisfied with the product but everyones body IS DIFFERENT DO NOT let others reviews turn you away from giving this product a shot. If it doesnt work for you you could always have it removed.','I was given Levaquin for a urinary tract infection after first trying Bactrim, which didn&039;t work.  I was really worried to use Levaquin because I read alot of bad reviews for it.  However, the only effect I had was that I felt speedy the first day I took it.  Subsequent days, I did not have this problem and I made sure to take it in the morning so it wouldn&039;t affect my sleep.  It cured my infection wonderfully, and I had no upset stomach or yeast infection after effects.  Three months later, I got another urinary tract infection, and Levaquin again did the trick.  I really like this antibiotic','I was originally prescribed something else  then I somehow got switched to Guildess fe, which wasn&039;t too bad. I was getting headaches, everyday with those. Now, the insurance sent me Blisovi Fe. Since I been taking the blisovi my period has increased In length, cramps in intensity, and heaviness in bleeding, including clots. Im hungry almost all the time, and my bra no longer fits completely (size D, before pill). The only thing this pill is effective in, is keeping you from getting pregnant. I had a scare and I did not get pregnant. But I never missed a pill and took at the same time everyday, which I was told makes it more effective.I am switching to an IUD soon because I cannot keep taking diff BC brands without warning.','Nausea after 3rd day. Some disorientation-dizziness on 6th day Nervousness-shakiness after 4 days. DOES KILL the bacteria well, though.','So I&039;ve been on this for about 6 weeks or more and I haven&039;t lose a pound I don&039;t have any side effects nor an appetite so I guess that&039;s a good thing... I&039;ll keep at it for a little longer to see if it&039;ll work for me At this point I&039;m a little discouraged','The medicine worked great to counter my sinusitis and I was breathing better after just one dose. But the side effects are almost unbearable. Nausea, dizziness, headache, lightheaded, dry mouth and constipation. The dizziness and lightheadedness kicks in after about an hour of taking the pill and lasts for about 5 hours. Very difficult to function normally and trying to work while taking this medicine. ','Although I  loved the fact that this drug allowed me to have fewer periods, however the affect it had extreme mood swings, decrease sex drive, my personailty and my appetite was astronomical.','Does not work at all','Works well to reduce symptoms of ADHD.','I&039;ve had it off and on since 22yrs old. I&039;m 57 now and its harder to get rid of now. Indocin does help me and I take it minimally. It actually lifts my mood as well as reducing the inflammation but can cause a buzzed type feeling. I can tell all gout suffers to steer clear of High Fructose Corn Syrup as much as possible Avoid any soda pop as well.','Works great for me with anxiety and stress. I&039;m at 100mg daily. I have been taken it for about 6 months. Also helps with anger issues.','I have type 1 diabetes and because of high blood sugar levels I used to suffer from yeast infections at least twice a year. A friend told me about acidophilus pills and I am forever grateful. I take them by mouth a couple of times a month to prevent yeast infections and if I ever feel one coming on or just generally feel any kind of irritation I will break a pill in half and wet it a bit so its more comfortable and insert into the affected area. You definitely need to get comfortable with yourself to do that, but it&039;s so worth it. It won&039;t completely break down and might come back out after a couple days, but it works. Taking too many by mouth gave me a little bloating and gas, but I&039;ll take that over the painful infections. I hope this helps','I started the medicine 4 days ago and down 4 pounds already  It curbs my appetite and I don&039;t snack eat like I use to.  I have also noticed that I have more energy which keeps me moving throughout the day and wanting to walk when I get home  So far so good  I also feel focused I think the energy is helping boost my metabolism','I was diagnosed with PCOS in 2013 but did not start taking Metformin seriously until late 2014.  I am also prediabetic, which is what has jump started my desire to seriously lose weight.  I cannot speak for blood sugar levels as I have not had them rechecked, nor have I gotten my cycle back, but I also have a significant amount of weight to lose first.  I definitely experience upset stomach and pretty intense diarrhea; however, this only seems to happen if I do not watch my carb and/or sugar intake.  If I eat sensibly, I have little to no issues in the side effect department.  I am losing weight and moving more, and hope to one day not need medication anymore.','So, I was having symptoms of BV so I went to the doctor and found out it was a yeast infection, after using the cream for just 3 days (it was a 7 day dosage) I had a major reaction, bad vaginal pains I could barely sleep. I went back to the doctor who now says it was not a reaction but possibly herpes. I had no pain no issues or anything before this cream, now possibly herpes. I am waiting on my results and praying it was in fact a reaction to this horrible cream','Hello all I am sharing this because I want to reassure everyone that this drug does its job extremely well. I recently had gone off the pill and hadn&039;t had sex in a month due to me and my long term partner being split. We decided to get back together and have sex, however, it was unprotected and his sperm did go inside of me. I am almost positive I was on my most fertile day but here I am, 12 days later after taking the Plan B and I am not pregnant. I took it within two hours after having unprotected sex. I had lots of breast tenderness and swelling, mood swings, and right now I am experiencing heavy cramps. But I do want to ease people&039;s minds that this medicine is highly effective and it has relieved me because I am not ready for a bab','Never had any side effects from this medication apart from some occasional spotting. I had to switch due to no one carrying it where I moved too. I was overall very happy with this product.','I have had my Mirena for three months now. Insertion was only painful when measuring the uterus. I am a small girl (5&039;1 and 90 pounds) so this could be why it was painful. I had cramps for a few days but a heat pillow solved that. I had zero spotting after insertion and haven&039;t had a period since. Though my chest has grown about one size (nothing to complain about) and blemishes are starting to appear. My waist has become more curvy and sex drive more intense. Altogether I absolutely love it','This was my second time trying saphris. Throughout my first experience,  it worked great for my severe depression,  but caused me to gain 20  pounds in a very short time frame. This increase in weight wasn&039;t acceptable, as I battle with bulimia as well. The second time around,  a few years later,  I had high hopes for this medication,  as it had virtually wiped out my depression while on it in the past, and I was taking the precautionary measure of adding Effexor to my medication regimen to help counteract the side effect of increased hunger and weight gain. The Effexor did help with decreasing my appetite;  however the antidepressant effect was not nearly as strong for some reason.  It may have even worsened my depressive symptoms.','I was prescribed Augmfnyin 875 twice a day for a severe sinus infection and just after two pills (one day) I could see light at the end of a dark stuffy congested tunnel...I began feeling much better almost immediately but a side effect that almost subways happens to me with antibiotics....I got a yeast infection My doctor told me that this is common because an antibiotics job is to kill bacteria all whether good or bad....these include bacterial that naturally occur and are normal in the vaginal tract so my doctor usually prescribes something for a yeast infection. Other than that taken with food I did not have any side effects and feel much better..it&039;s amazing how quickly it works. After being miserable for days, I&039;m very happy','I am 17 and was on it for half a year and never had a period. I got off it in January and still today have no period and its been 10 months. ','This medicine was an extremely horrible experience for me. My doctor prescribed it to me for anxiety and day one sent me off the edge. How I felt during anxiety attacks was how this medication made me feel but fifty times worse. I felt like I drank a million milligrams of coffee and was on pins and needles for 8 hours. After reading these reviews I hate that it didn&039;t have the same affect on me as it did the majority. I hate anxiety but I can&039;t see myself taking another one of those pills EVER.','For the people who are worried about taking Tamiflu because of vomiting or worse symptoms, there is no need. I was worried of vomiting when my doctor prescribed it too me. To lessen the chance or basically exterminate the chance of vomiting, have a snack or a meal and you won&039;t feel a thing. It will feel like your taking a regular medicine.','Been on it reluctantly for two years at first did not work, tried others and went back to it. Originally 100mg no sex drive and extreme tiredness, cut in half deal with very very mild thoughts and occurrence of negativity, the sex drive modest and normal. So at 50mg slights on everything but able to function and think out problems instead of reacting horrible.','I take trazodone to help balance the effects Cymbalta had on my sleep and to help with my depression. My experience has been wonderful, helps me fall asleep and sleep restfully. Together with Cymbalta, Trazodone has completely eradicated my depression.','Using this for parasomnia, bph and bp. Kind of silver bullet. But my new doc tried to give me the brand name... Is it an extended release or just much more expensive? I only take it at night and dizziness hasnt been an issue. Seems to work as well as other bph meds that I have tried, my bp has also been reasonable. Seems to make sleepwalking more infrequent which is why I tried it.','I&039;ve been using Contrave for over a month.  I&039;ve lost 2 pounds and the ONLY side effect is dry mouth - nothing else.  I&039;m hopeful.','My husband tested positive for the flu on 2nd day of having symptoms. His Dr prescribed Tamiflu for both he and I since I slept in same bed while he was sick. One day later, I started to feel symptoms as well...aches, chills &amp; fever. I immediately started the tamiflu &amp; was only out of commission for 1 full day. Tamiflu is amazing if you start it early enough.','I&039;m currently 22 and I&039;ve had my IUD for close to four years (March) I love it. I do have to warn though. It does cause heavier periods for the first few months. Mine went from three days to about a week long. There will be cramping. It is painful some days. But I&039;ve never had cramps to begins with. So this was new. If you can get through the first 4-6 months of this, it is the best form of birth control. I always recommend it to my lady friends.','I have only tried the generic version of Cialis so maybe the real thing would work better, but it does nothing for me except a slight thickening of the penis. That would be fine if I were taking the drug recreationally, but I do actually need some help.  I regularly take Kamagra, which is generic Viagra, and that does work. Viagra is better, and I can get away with half the dose that I use for Kamagra, but it still costs 5 times as much. The slight difference is that Viagra swell the penis a little and possibly numbs it s little too, making you last longer.  But if I had to rely on Cialis, I would have no sex life, effectively. It must just be me, or at least ineffective for some people, because many people swear by it.','I have been on nexplanon since 2-20-17 and have had a non stop period since two weeks after it was inserted',Headache,'Initial use info and review. Little dizzy and nausea the first day. So far, blood sugar readings are dropping. Was around 107-117. Now at 83. A1C is at 6.7. Looking forward to dropping THAT number. Next A1C read is in mid July. No other adverse affects so far.  (This &quot;Anti-Spam&quot; verification is ridiculous)','My new GP has been recommending Valium for over a year for chronic mid-back/facet joint paint and intermittent neck pain (bad disks from C3-C5) and sciatica/torn labrum at right hip, but I resisted her recommendation.  The chronic back pain flares every night, and often wakes me up and forces me out of bed.  It takes several hours for the pain to recede every morning, which is demoralizing.  Three nights ago I started taking 5 mg of valium at bedtime, and each morning I&039;ve awakened with less and less pain so that I&039;m hardly taking any pain medication during the day.  Fingers crossed that I can continue to take this dose at bedtime - the other testimonials on this website are giving me hope that this might be the case  Hallelujah','First had implanon then got Nexplanon, had a period first month and I have not had one since. I&039;m due to remove it next year.  I do notice spotting  sometimes for a day but it honestly  usually coincides with when I&039;m stressed.  Had some weight gain also.  So far the best BC I&039;ve  had in all my years.  I plan on trying for a baby next year then I will be back on it.','I have taken this medicine for 7 years. Gained lots of weight, now on Weight Watchers Diet and lost 16lbs so far.  Very happy now. At 45mg had bad restless legs, reduced to 30mg and sleep great 9 or 10 hours. Had intolerable insomnia my entire life before.  Wonder what would happen if reduced it to 15 mg. Also added 20 mg Prozac for daytime energy and works great.','Binders made of lactate are not good for my stomach, the 443 and dark blue pill work best for me.','I also have knee pain, shoulder pain, elbow and hand and finger pain.  Norco seems to work best on the knee pain.','I have only been on orsythia for about 1 month and I just started my second week of my second month.  I guess I didn&039;t notice earlier but I started to get slight headaches and I didn&039;t feel very well physically and mentally.  It do help with my cramps and my period, not so much my acne but it&039;s better.  The worst part of orsythia has to be the mood swings and the sweating  I sweat a lot even if it&039;s cold I&039;ll start a light sweat, it&039;s gross.  But the mood swings are the worst I just started feeling this and it happened while I was talking to one of my friends I just blew up on him, for no reason.  Then later on I started to feel really bad(mentally) and I cried for a while and I couldn&039;t figure out why I was crying I don&039;t recommend','I received my first Lupron shot a couple weeks ago. In the past two weeks I have noticed that my pain isn&039;t as bad or as often and it was before the shot. The down side is the mood swings and hot flashes. I thought I had a few weeks before I started experiencing the side effects, but I guess not. I know that the next six months are going to be rough, but the way I see it...I&039;ve been suffering for five years already, what is six months of hell to help make it all go away? In my opinion, the Lupron shot is worth it.','Began taking Qsymia 3.75 in June 2013. Its one year later I have lost 80 pounds. At the low dose I experience few side effects while still suppressing my urge to overeat. I&039;ve used My Fitness Pal to track my 1200-1500 calories a day menus. No sugar cravings any more. For the last few weeks I have diminished my dosage to 3 times a week as I&039;ve approached my maintenance weight goal. The weight loss has been easy. Now to figure out how Q can help me maintain the loss.','After a few days of use I had such horrible itching it prevented me from sleeping. The itching took about a week after discontinued use to subside.','Some of these experiences are quite alarming I never experienced the really harsh side effects such as depression, suicidal thoughts and any other bad side effects. I&039;ve been taking Concerta ever since I was 8. I was taken off of Concerta when I was 21 and I actually went down hill after that. I lost a lot of my friends and I can&039;t control my thoughts, day dreams and mood swings and my performance at my job declined rapidly to the point where I almost lost it. I am 23 now and just got back on Concerta and am super happy with how it has organized my mind .','I&039;m 20, 5ft and 97lbs. I&039;ve been on Ocella for 4ish years now. I originally was on Yaz then Yasmin the. When Ocella came out I switched. For me, the experience was normal. I was moody on my periods (nothing new) and a big decrease in acne But now I am thinking of switching to a stronger birth control, even though I&039;ve been on Ocella for so long and love the product I think my body needs a change in medication. I&039;m becoming a little more irritated then the first 2 years, my nipples are especially tender after my period which never happened before. It&039;s time for a change. Overall a great product if you would like to see a decrease in acne, no weight gain, no pregnancy scares, no depression or moodiness for the most part. Good for older teens','I can&039;t function without it. I&039;m 20 years old and it turned my life around, the only thing was it gave me heart palpitations but its easily curable with a lower dose. I was taking 20 mg. I&039;m going to try it 10 mg. Too much makes you stay up for ages.','This drug works mildly, not as well as stimulant medications like adderall.   Unfortonately while it mildly boosted concentration and motivation it severely increased my anxiety, ,heart rate, and tremors.   Stimulant medications actually decreased my natural tremors.   My pupils were always dialated as well.  To me this drug is a stimulant like super caffeine not a medicational stimulant.','I had Skyla inserted 9/18/15. Never have I ever been pregnant.  I was 26 at the time of insertion. Insertion was VERY painful.  While the insertion was painful it lasted only 2-3 mins. I had slight pain for 3 days with MAJOR bloating.  I spotted every day for 8 months. It was enough I had to wear a panty liner. Eventually spotting stopped. My periods are irregular, when I did get one I would bleed for 15-20 days. It was always dark, thick tissue that I bled. I had severe cramps not only on my period but randomly. Severe 8/10 pain. I just had the device removed 11/30/17. While it did prevent pregnancy and I had minimal side effects. The prolonged bleeding, the pain, and unpredictability of getting my period made me choose to remove it.','I have been struggling with my weight for some time now and decided to speak with my Internist to see if she would give me a script for something that would curb my appetite for sweets &amp; fast food. She prescribed Contrave, honestly I&039;ve never heard of this drug before. Did some research &amp; read everyone&039;&039;s comments and honestly, I was frightened by the many side effects. I&039;m so desperate to lose the weight, I started my first dose today. I took the pill around 7:30 this morning and didn&039;t begin to feel nauseated until around noon. Since most of the suggestions, said to drink water to help with the nausea. I found when I ate a few saltine crackers the nausea went away. Then came a slight headache. Other than that, I&039;m fine. Good luck everyone','Anger, moodiness, hopelessness, irritability, trouble making cohesive thoughts, very serious suicidal urge.     Same day after first pill of 500 mg.','Long story short: I&039;ve never been able to take a BCP that didn&039;t cause dibilitating side effects until now I can&039;t believe it  For years I have tried many different birth control methods including combination pills of all kinds and the ring. With each one, I would have terrible nausea, intractable vomiting, and eventually migranes.  At first, my doctor told me I just needed to stick with it longer. Well, when I had to pull over on my ten minute drive on the highway to vomit on my way to work, I decided I couldn&039;t do it anymore.  I recently got a new midwife. She suggested this and I&039;m SO HAPPY. It&039;s been about a week and I&039;ve had absolutely zero side effects. Call me crazy, but I think my libido and mood have actually elevated?','I got epiduo the summer of 7th grade bc my acne was horrible and nothing seemed to clear it up. I went to the dermatologist and he gave me epiduo and a facial wash. by the time summer was over, I had very clear skin. although it took a while to kick in, as long as you are consistent with it every night you will see results. I also had to use a night cream bc it made my face dry. but I just used an over the counter one and it worked just fine.','I am 10 weeks into the 12 week treatment with interferon, ribavarin, and Sovaldi. This is my 2nd time around on treatment. My first was with interferon, ribavirin and Victrelis.  I relapsed  the first time and was very very ill during the entire 7 months. This treatment with Sovaldi is a cake walk. The side effects are so minimal compared to last time. I am ill, weak, have insomnia, bone pain and fever but I can do this for 12 weeks if it means a cure. I am so thankful for Sovaldi. I was very hesitant to start treatment again but I am so glad I did. My insurance covered some and Sovaldi covered the difference up to $5 per month. Thank you.','I have suffered with low back pain - 2 surgeries for spinal fusion as well as any other procedure out there.  I now have a rod in my spine with 6 screws to secure a failed fusion.  I have been on Norco for two years and tried going up to oxycodone or percocet and found the Norco much more helpful so switched back.','Istarted taking Sertraline 11 months ago due to anxiety caused through major life traumas and problems but work tipped me over the edge.  I felt like i was unable to smile fuction talk and walk some days horrible feeling so went to Doctors and started treament.  No side effects and after 2 weeks the black cloud lifted from my life  I cant tell you how brilliant i feel im generaly happy calm and do not over react anymore.  I do not plan on coming off this medication at all... I am 52 years old.','Works every time.','I have had no negative side effects wit this birth control. I have tried about ten different kinds of birth control pills before trying Depo and all of the pills made me an emotional mess. I have no complaints about Depo, I didn&039;t gain weight, no periods, no crazy emotions.','I have been using the Depo for 2 1/2 years now. I noticed during the first year I would spot lightly when I usually got my period and my cramps went away. After the first year my period pretty much went away for the most part. However, when I do occasionally get spotting, it lasts for about 2 weeks and it comes at random times. In the past year I can recall it happening three times. For me it still beats getting reglar periods and it has taken away my horrible cramps so I deal with it. The pill always made me sick no matter what brand I tried so that is another plus with the Depo.  But everyone is different and everyone will react differently.','I was on orthotricyclen which really cleared my skin but my new doctor decided to switch Bc on me to trinessa and I&039;ve been getting more than the typical one or two on my cheeks. And I never break out on my forehead but I started to with trinessa. Trinessa is horrible in helping acne','The horrible side effects (even with HRT) were not worth it. The hot flashes, joint pain, mood swings, depression and long-term effects on my bones were NOT worth it.  I really wish doctors would stop trying to give me this as it only does harm.  Endometriosis can only be helped by EXCISION by a skilled surgeon, and will only last for up to a few years. Please stop getting doctors to postpone proper treatment with this.','I got the Nexplanon in August, 2 months after having my 2nd son. I had my period September but for 3 weeks I hated that part. It is now October and I haven&039;t had my period. I am going to take a pregnancy test, just in case. But I hope it&039;s just the birth control causing me not to have started yet. Other than that I love this form of birth control and will definitely get it again. I did have hives and still get them but its nothing manageable and not enough to give it a bad rap.','I have been taking Seroquel 200mg for over a year for Bipolar Disorder. After years of taking antidepressants I couldn&039;t figure out why they weren&039;t working.  I was having really bad manic episodes that would last days to weeks, in which I was staying up for days at a time, spending money I didn&039;t have and extreme OCD.  My anxiety and mood swings were spinning out of control and I was failing as a mother.  I started therapy and Seroquel and noticed an immediate difference in my manic episodes and insomnia.  I gained weight at first but have since lost it over the course of the year.  I am taking Aderrall during the day and I am back in college, working as a full time accountant and am able to relax at night with my family.','Started using Testim but had ups and downs and stunk like bad perfume and was changed to Androgel. Like it&039;s smell and dries really well but my level is going backwards again. Thinking about going back on Testim.','I always get nausea and vomiting with anesthesia even when taking other anti-nausea meds. Was given Emend prior to gallbladder removal.

I take 54 mg methylphenidate xr, along with 225 mg effexor xr.','I didn&039;t like Topamax. I became very paranoid, anxious and since I have been off of it I still have mild side effects from it. Not a good experience. Glad it works for some.','I am a 35 year-old female. I&039;ve always been a melancholic person (given my family history of anxiety and anger issues) but when I was younger, I have been able to experience some happiness. As I got older and had two kids, it got worse. I would get angry or sad at a drop of a hat, after which I would sink into depression. It also became more difficult to manage stress and anxiety. I began seeing a therapist who suggested that I get a physical with my primary care physician and ask if I can get a prescription for anti-depressants. I was put on 10 mg. of Lexapro. During the first few days, I was light-headed, groggy, and aware of every sensation in my body. I was also very thirsty. After a week, I felt the benefits. I feel happy again.','I have used this drug for several years now and have had good success with it. I am on the 100mg and for the most part this will do the trick if I catch it in time.','If you get a cold sore outbreak in your mouth. Don&039;t walk, RUN to the nearest medical practitioner that can give you a prescription of Acyclovir. Usually an outbreak would last me 3 weeks with just using over the counter creams. With the medication, my mouth was back to normal after 4 days.','Severe bloating , abdominal pains. When it does work , I get diarrhea along with cramps.  I actually think this made me more constipated.','Made me jittery and could not sleep. Lost weight but side effects were very bad. Doctor switched me to Belviq. See what happens. No insurance coverage yet. Still fighting for it with them.','This is my third round of orthovisc. My great fear was the pain during the injections as well as after. I got the first round last Monday. The first knee was killer  For the other knee she used lidocaine type medicine and then the orthovisc. Easy peazy  I am eager to get back on my bike and ride until winter gives me no choice but to stay indoors. I am grateful for orthovisc. I&039;ve had 3 years of success - although I do NOT recommend waiting a year between treatments. It was a bad decision for me.','52 hrs old, I started taking Flomax for BPH. It completely blocked my sinus. So I asked for something different. My urologist prescribed Rapaflo, but they blocked sinus was even worse and it cost me 260.00 for 30 pills Horrible medicine Avoid at all costs.','I have been on Ambien for many years and it stopped working for me. My dr. has tried some other meds, but so far nothing seems to work. I&039;ve been on Elavil for about a week now and it seems as if I&039;m taking a sugar pill. It&039;s just not working for me I wish it did work as well for as it has for others.','I started this medication for Gastroparesis after 11 months of not being able to keep anything down. I noticed it helping after first two doses. I was so excited until the awful side effects started. Drowsiness to the point I couldn&039;t function, severe stomach and back pain and bowel issues. I had to stop after 5 days in order to be able to take care of my family. So disappointed.','Having suffered gout a couple of times a year, indomethacin was my drug of choice, combined with  omeprazole to protect the stomach. Although it did often make me drowsy and slightly upset my stomach, the pain relief was quick and inflammation would ease quickly. BUT... always continue to take the prescribed dose until the flare up has completely cleared. This time I didn&039;t and it came back with a vengenance, to the point indo had no effect. Now on colchicine instead which, after 24 hours, has had no effect and does not relief pain so I am in agony (GP never thought of that). Praying this new drug begins to work soon - two nights without sleep.. keep taking the indomethacin until everything has gone... Am starting anapurirnol ASAP','I can only review the insertion as I have just gotten Paragard today. I am in my 20s and have never had a child or iud. I was prepared for the worst, but in reality it was about 30 seconds of discomfort, followed by a few hours of light cramping. No actual pain, and insertion was not accompanied by bleeding.','I didn&039;t get motion sickness until AFTER we got off our 7 day cruise.  I have been fighting nausea and dizziness for a week now (The doctor said it is normal to suffer this after a cruise), after reading these reviews, I went and bought Bonine. I took one pill and I feel great  Sure wish I had researched this a week ago','I have been a heavy opiate user for 15 years.  I did have years staying &quot;clean&quot; using soboxone but once I got divorced I became depressed and relapsed.  My addiction took off and I ended up using IV heroin and at that point trying to go back and use soboxone to stay clean was impossible. It took a overdose and 30 day treatment to make the decision to get the injection and it saved my life, best drug in the world.  I know people have fears of breaking a bone or being in severe pain while being on a long lasting opiate blocker but as a paramedic there is 1 opiate narcotic that will not be blocked by vivitrol...I won&039;t tell you which but all docs and paramedics know...so have no fear, DO IT I have never been happier','I took this antibiotic the second time I had a UTI. I had a quantity of 28 pills, but I was only meant to take 14 in a course of 7 days.  (why would they prescribe me 14 more pills ?) So, after my 14th pill, my UTI symptoms never stopped. So I took the 15th pill. Immediately, I broke out in hives and rashes all over my body. so I stopped taking the antibiotic. The rash was so violent and itchy, I had to go to the emergency room where they gave me an IV with saline, benadryl, and steriods to help with my allergic reaction.  many other people have allergic reactions  on this antibiotic. As if she wanted me to overdose So please, I beg of you to do your research on this antibiotic. It could be life threatening','I have been on this medication for a month and I have not experience one side effect.  SO MUCH better than the shots. We will see later if it is as effective as they say it is.','Wanted to share this with everyone. I was given this mediation 6 years ago. I had a lot of problems like fibromyalgia, migraines, depression, insomnia, IBS -C. I was taken a lot of different meds for all these problems, but nothing worked. When I was first put on this medication at 25mg I could sleep for the first time in years. I was waking up on the morning refreshed and happy. I noticed about 6 months later my migraines were not as often as I normally would have them. As time went on I needed my meds to be increased. I now take 150mg. This drug is a life saver. My fibromyalgia pain is less, migraines less, anxiety way less and it also improved my IBS C symptoms. I would recommend this Medication to anyone with any of these problem','Wellbutrin has significantly improved my overall concentration above all else. For the first time in many years, I have been able to actually sit down and read contently without my mind wondering. I wish I had this medication before I graduated from university, my grades would probably have been much better. I take this in combination with Cipralex. I have had no side effects with this medication.','I thought the shot would be easy due to the fact of taking it every three months compared to the pill taking it everyday, but the shot does not work for my body I have been bleeding for over a month now.

I have been taking two a day for 12 years and have not needed to increase dosage. To me it was a miracle drug.','I have taken Lamotrigine for years. It has been effective but I have gradually had more side effects.  These reviews have been very helpful as I thought some of my problems were created by the sun, humidity or allergy.  Over time and sporadically I have had more nausea, chills, a lot of itching. If I scratch the itch at all the skin turns bright red and spreads along with itching.  The itching is horrible.  3 days after 50mg increase I have all the above side effects plus sweats, chills and flu like symptoms. Have extremely strange dreams and nightmares.  I didn&039;t have these side effects when I first started the medicine. They started gradually and I think it is time to look for a different medicine.','Yes it is effective as a birth control contraceptive. The side effects I have had loss of sex drive, moodiness, weight gain and an irregular menstrual cycle. I stopped taking that pack of pills the end of January 2014 as of now I have yet to have a menstrual cycle. Something is right.','I have Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus. I have a complicated internal body structure. I have been very very tired and after reading the side effects I do believe taking nitrofurantoin is the whole cause.

I started having weird feelings, like I was going to die, I kept ending up in the ER. The doctors kept telling me it was Anxiety. I DIDN&039;T understand why anxiety would make me feel this way. When the Anxiety would kick in, I literally thought I was dying. My heart would race, my body would get tingles and I would feel chokingness. It was scary and still is. I have tried many, many anxiety medicines, Paxil, Effexor, Xanax, Lamictal, Geodon, and many more. NONE have worked the way Klonopin works. With Klonopin I feel safe and I do not get the jittery feelings. I am so grateful to have a medication that actually works for me. If I miss a dose I will get severe anxiety and a panic attack.','I have been self medicating for years with tramadol. I suffer from anxiety, panic attacks, and depression.

It is however, so very expensive. ','Have been on it for a month, age 26. Also use Retin-A and Acyanya. Works very well. Very happy with results. No side effects.','This is a much more potent pain relief than Demerol.','I have found the medication invaluable for Poison Oak rashes.','I had a broken toe and it worked great for the pain.','I am 6 weeks pregnant and ended up with my first UTI. I was prescribed Macrobid because I am very allergic to Sulfa antibiotics, which landed me in a hospital a few years back. Upon reading the reviews I was so incredibly terrified to take this medication, but I had no choice. I&039;ll consider myself lucky, but so far I have found that Macrobid is actually quite tolerable. I&039;ve been a bit more tired and achy than usual and had some mild nausea, but nothing too severe. I have found that taking with a full meal is critical and drinking TONS of fluid (water/Gatorade) helps with side effects. But for me this is really a reminder to take reviews with a grain of salt - you really have no idea how your body will react until you try it yourself.','I tried this brand for the first time. My previous option makes me drowsy.  Back to the point,the only thing robitussin has done for me is caused gas and random bowel movements.  No help in the intended propose.','Pros: I can sleep through the night &amp; my appetite has come back Cons: All I want to eat are sweets &amp; I eat more than normal I was prescribed mirtazapine by my psychiatrist because I was waking up every three hours during the night. I was never getting any true, restful sleep. Now, I sleep through the night with NO nightmares. Another reason he prescribed it to me is to gain some weight. I&039;ve always been skinny but I have battled with anorexia in the past. Recently, due to lack of appetite, I lost 5 pounds. I was already 120 pounds so I didn&039;t have much to lose to begin with. I got my appetite back and I feel like a bottomless pit. I want sweets more than anything. I feel like I eat so much more than I did before I started this medication.','I have had migraines since I was 12 yrs. Old, I am 67. As a child I just suffered all the time. When I was in my late 20&039;s, fiorinal was the answer. It did help. There have been a couple of others (can&039;t remember the name). Then imitrex came out. Didn&039;t work. I did not find relief, even with addition of percocet until maxalt came out. Thank heavens. Mostly 20 days per month. I learned very quickly first sign for me is a slice of pain, then I immediately take the maxalt. Within a half hour, 99\% gone. I have been so fortunate to have medicine coverage through private employer insurance with reasonable copay, otherwise it would affect my ability to support myself. I take over 12 meds per day..No interactions','I was on Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo for about 2 months. Couldn&039;t continue with them due to the side effects. I was terribly hormonal and I wanted to eat everything in sight. I cried all the time and everything made me upset and moody. At the time I was 17 (now 18), 5&039;4&quot; and about 118lbs. It made me gain weight and go up to 126lbs that I now have trouble getting rid of. Hope this helps','My a1c is in the normal range now, and I have lost 42 lbs. All my labs are great due to the weight loss. I have been on 10mcg for over 2 years. My last a1c was so good last time, my doctor wants me to decrease to 5mcg. I have been to several dermatologists over the last 2 years trying to figure out why I am having hair loss, unhealthy hair, and change in texture. I never wanted to attribute it to the Byetta although the hair loss started a few months after I began taking it. I am now so desperate to stop the hair loss, I&039;m considering stopping the Byetta. I can&039;t decide which would be worse - being bald or gaining back 42 pounds I would really love to know if the person who recently posted had any hair regrowth after stopping Byetta.','This product has worked 100\% for me. It did take a full 3 months to show full effect but truly- that&039;s it- one year on and I no longer have acne at all ever- gone I have had regular breakouts since I was a teenager and at aged 42 I had finally had enough of the itchy lumps and bumps. Sometimes these spots would come to a head, other times, just linger for weeks. My face look dirty and dull and often felt sore either before I squeezed a spot or after.  I was prescribed Epiduo by my GP in Australia and although I did have some initial redness, soreness and peeling, my skin quickly adjusted and now for the first time since I was 10 years old my skin is clear, everyday, all year round. No breakouts, I just wish I&039;d given it a try years ago','Colazal completely rid me of all Crohn&039;s symptoms after years of suffering. I&039;m worried now, after 4-5 yrs symptom free I need a kidney transplant. Will I still be able to use it if I get a flare up?','62 year old male, diagnosed with IBS-C at age 57.  The product literature for Linzess says it is not a laxative, but with me it operates just like a laxative.  I take it on an empty stomach, it works in 3 hours, it causes the same sort of watery stool as mag cit, but it is finished after 3 trips rather than 20, and my doctor says Mag cit will cause kidney damage, Linzess won&039;t.   I took Amitiza intermittently for 5 years, 16 mcg at a time, usually with similar results.  This notion that Linzess causes less cramping during buildup or that it calms the colon seems like marketing jive.  I wish it came as a tablet that could be cut, I think the standard dose is too strong for me.','Have been taking for 40 plus years for migraines.  I use Fiorinal 3, only when Fiorinal does not work.  No side effects at all.','Average-- not satisfied -- symptoms continue','I&rsquo;ve been taking Yasmin for 6 years now and have had no issues I switched to a cheaper brand that was similar to Yasmin for a couple months and I started to get multiple bladder infections so I switched back to Yasmin. Still no problems other than decreased libido.','Had this for 1 year &amp; 1 month to be exact. First 5 months were horrible. Irregular periods &amp; I always felt like I was pregnant, but as months went past... my periods became regular again &amp; I always forget I have it in my arm. Very effective, really does prevent pregnancy My only concern is when it&039;s time to come out, I&039;ve seen too many videos where it was hard for it to come out.','I just started my 3rd month on Contave. I am currently down 26lbs. I did not notice a change in appetite until week 4-6. I did figure out if I take before dinner (not after) I eat less. I can not even eat 1/2 of what I used to eat. My only problem is terrible cotton mouth, jolly ranchers have become my best friend.','I was born into the middle of WWII in England and have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Also was sexually assaulted at the age of 4 yrs. I came over here to the States at the age of 13 and it all went downhill from there. I have major depression and have been on Prozac for many, many years. I have also been taking Klonopin for as many years and it has given me some kind of normal life. I used to get the tremors so bad that the ambulance people thought it was a grand mal seizure attack. I still get these attacks once in a while but with the help of Klonopin I can actually calm myself back to a normal state of being. I wouldn&039;t call it a wonder medicine but it certainly helps me.','For me, it was not quite as good as Restoril and Dalmane, but it is right up there.','I knew it was risky to take an antidepressant given my symptoms but I was having trouble in my daily life and needed help. I began taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg and for the first week I felt an increase in suicidal thoughts, tremors, and psychomotor agitation. It felt like I was going to die. After that week, my psychiatrist added Klonopin to help control these side effects. Since then, I have had an improvement in quality of life, which is all I can ask for.','I took Lopressor for 24 years it worked very well in lowering my blood pressure and even calming my anxiety but lately it doesn&039;t work on me very well as before, I guess the doctor will change it.','I started this medication because I had to stop taking the oral, which worked wonderful so switched to transdermal. Shortly after starting the patch I had a constant dull headache but thought maybe my body needed to adjust so I continued. On my second week the headache continued and my joints started bothering me and then progressed to body aches, feeling like I had the flu. I also had stomach issues with excessive burping and gas. No energy, emotionally feeling blah. I took the patch off to see if symptoms would improve. Overnight the achy body is gone but still have the mild headache no stomach issues so far. This medicine is not cheap even with insurance and I am now contacting the pharmacy to see if I can return my 90 day supply.','I am a 33 year old mother of 2 who was ready to give up on life.  Started taking 10mg of Lexapro and eventually increased to 20mg.  Have been taking for about a year and a half.  Although still dealing with a few side effects, (insomnia, weight gain, and waking up with headaches), Lexapro has truly saved my life.  I can now be the kind of mother and wife that my family deserves. ','I completely support the first review. I have had insomnia for many years and tried everything from herbs to drugs. And only this could help and provide a good rest during the night. I have already taken this medication for over 5 years, about 25mg not more. It is enough to get 8 hours with no dreams sleep ','I had never hard of naproxen sodium before but I had a bad headache at work and my friend gave it to me.  It worked well and fast.  I would definitely take it again.','Zoloft was very effective for about 2 years then I became immune to it and my bipolar depression returned.','I&039;ve been on this birth control for about 3 years and it has been great. It does the job. I thought iId write this review because I didn&039;t see many write ups about the generic version (MyLan) and I have been on both the brand name (Generess) for about 2 years or so and then switched to the generic for price purposes and have been on that for at least a year. I started Generess when I was in highschool because I had really uncomfortable heavy 7 day periods and was also in a long term relationship. I am now in college and when I switched to the generic version I had no change in side effects or periods. I very rarely get a period (5&039;4, 115 pounds) and had no weight gain that I can attribute to the pill. My skin is clear and never got pregnant','DRINK LOTS OF WATER  I go every morning like clock work.   But due to surgery I had to take pain killers and I wasn&039;t able to go for 4 days. My friend (who takes it regularly due to her celiac disease which causes her a lot of stomach issues) brought me a pack for me to use and she told me water is the key and it&039;s true.  After I took one, I read the reviews below and freaked.  You only need one. I took 1 pill at 7:30pm and with two bottles of 750ml of water. At 8am I started to feel a little cramp &amp; a light body ache and I had my bowel movement. Then another one 20 mins later and a third about an hour later. I had smooth clean bowel movement each time.     DRINK WATER and 1 PILL','It&039;s a great birth control... but only because I have had a heavy period (that my doctor is prescribing me birth control pills for) so I am not having any sex with my husband. No one told me I wouldn&039;t stop having a period.','Started taking for a sinus infection.  By day three the searing ear pain was gone totally, my facial swelling was gone and my acne really improved  There is a really funny taste in my mouth, but I notice it got better when I drink a lot of water. Great experience overall.','Have had pain all my life, some is from fibromyalgia. Cymbalta worked well for pain such as the electrical zapping sensations. However, it is much too expensive and was not very effective for anxiety or depression.','Best antibiotic I&039;ve used. I&039;ve never had a problem. And it always get rid of the problem.','Worked great A miracle I smoked for 33 years and have now been smoke free for 4 1/2 years','I love NuvaRing.  It&039;s so much easier than the pill and it makes me feel safer because it&039;s a lot harder to mess up.  The only problem is that it&039;s really expensive.','I have been using Aviane for almost a year now and I would have to say that the only side effects I noticed was my skin has been a little bit more oily and I get 3 to 4 days of spotting before my regular period. Because of this the doctor is making me switch to Ortho Tri Cycen Lo, hopefully I don&039;t run into any problems but I don&039;t even want to switch. I love Aviane.','I&039;m on my 4th day of the dosage. Since day one of taking it I started vomiting a couple hours of the dose. Been like that ever since, vomiting and diarrhea all day.  Today I started eating yogurt after taking it on recommendation of the pharmacist. It has helped some and cut down the severely and frequency of the vomiting  and diarrhea but hasn&039;t eliminated it. Can&039;t wait to reach day 7 to be done.. I called the doctor, only thing he said was I had to keep taking it or I&039;d be admitted to hospital. Screw that I&039;ll deal with the stomach issues. Good luck to you if prescribed it and try the yogurt it helps. BTW, pepto will make you immediately puke if you try to take some while on bactrim. I dunno why, but from my personal experience it does, beware','I was prescribed this to treat my sinus infection. It&039;s been almost two days now and while I feel slightly better, the nausea and upset stomach is too much for me. I have eaten both yogurt or rice before taking it and I still get very sick. It is also making everything I eat seem extremely salty. Even when I breathe, I taste salt. I&039;ve called my doctor and they&039;re changing my antibiotic to something else. Apparently this one is making my potassium levels rise too high.','I am 21 years old, First time on birth control although I had looked into options before but decided I wanted to have a baby. I had a miscarriage a month ago now I don&039;t want to have a baby so close after so I needed a B.C. method I wasn&039;t going to forget (pills) or have to go in regularly for (depo) so this seems like a good fit. Insertion was painful but it only lasted about 2/3 minutes and felt like sharp pinching/poking. I feel some cramps (not too bad) and some spotting. I read other women went when they were on their period I still hadn&039;t had my period again but when I do it&039;s moderate lasts about 4 days. I get more cramping then bleeding. I will update with how it affects my period or if cramps continue because this is just day 1','I hope my experience helps someone. I&039;m 20 years old and had unprotected sex with my boyfriend on 11/04. It was about one week after my period had ended on 10/27 and technically during my sugar pill week. However, I missed a few pills during my month and knew I was not fully protected. The morning after I experienced bright red bleeding and feared that it may have been implantation bleeding (unlikely). I panicked and took Plan B 48 hours after. My period was one week late and came on 12/04, ~ one month after I took Plan B. I experienced extreme tiredness, swollen breasts (increased a cup size), cravings and light cramps all similar to pregnancy symptoms Don&039;t panic. Allow your body to adjust there&039;s a great chance you aren&039;t pregnant','Took it for 2 weeks and my condition got worse. Not worth the side effects--dry eyes, mouth and skin, lethargic and sleepy. Had to go 5-6 times a night and sometimes 10 times before lunch.','Helped me to stop crying on a daily basis which I was doing because of my Fibromyalgia pain. Still have the pain, but have a better attitude.','Excellent results','I have been on 10mg. of Lexapro for about 4 weeks. I think in the first few weeks it made my depression worse. I began to have very crazy scary thoughts. I held on, now I am just sort of o.k., I am having a few hours a day of feeling a lot of relief, but still the morning is a down hill slope. I am going to give it a few more weeks. My anxiety has gotten a bit better.','I&039;m sixteen years old and yes it had prevented pregnancy and it makes me feel protected. I didn&039;t experience mood swings, depression or anything emotional wise. I did gain about 10 pounds and I can&039;t say that I&039;m complaining lol. Although honestly I hate it my doctor asked me to come in and get it in while I was on my period. After that i never got off my period and I got a nasty discharge. So I went back to my OBGYN and gave me some pill to &quot;fix my period pattern&quot; which made it worst. I took all the pills and I&039;m still on my period everyday and it&039;s very heavy.I don&039;t  recommend this I don&039;t recommend birth control at all forget sex this is not worth it and I regret it all.','My 8 year old was put on Keppra for complex partial seizures.  Except for some initial tiredness in the first two weeks she has had no side effects.  She takes 250mg twice a day.  She even won her age group in a 1mile race two weeks ago and her competitive soccer team won their soccer tournament this weekend thanks to some of the goals she scored.  I have noticed no difference in her school work or personality.  I am so thankful for this medicine that my daughter can continue her active life seizure free.','I have horrible anxiety problems, so much so, it makes me physically nauseous and vomit. My stomach will turn and no appetite. After taking hydroxyzine 10mg 4 times a day, my nausea is gone. I feel like I have my life back. I was losing weight and much needed nutrients. Nothing has helped me like this.','I just started 2 months ago I&039;m entering my 3rd month today but I can say that it&039;s going okay so far considering that I have tried other birth control and they were awful but so far my two periods have been light between 2-3 days light cramping so that a plus I also feel more tired been sleeping extra hours but the birth control seems to be working in going to keep trying it and see how it keeps working . And about acne before I started this birth control I had blackheads , whitehead and I would get a few pimples it hasn&039;t changed much some days I notice my face looks cleaner with less acne than others but I never really have had a lot of acne .','I took this for one week.  It did not help me get to sleep at all. On the first night I was awake ALL NIGHT LONG.  Second night I finally fell asleep at 3am. I had to start back on Seroquel to get to sleep at all.  I have stopped taking Rozerem because by the 6th night I had an AWFUL headache. Tonight is night two without Rozerem and I am hoping that by the time I wake up tomorrow it will be out of my system and the headache will be gone.','Within a few days after minor knee surgery I have had serious loose stools several times a day for four months.','Stomach cramps every day and night','I have severe psoriatic arthritis and I&039;ve had it since I was 18.

Makes me sleepy but I&rsquo;m ok by 10:00 am with sheer guts and. Coffee.  I am thankful for these medicines.','I was diagnosed with collagenous colitis/microscopic colitis in October 2016. After going thru 2 different steroids and &quot;diets&quot; to try to improve my leaky gut this has proven the best yet. I&039;ve been on it since November 2016, 1 packet a day. I was weary at first about taking it because it isn&039;t well studied but after 3 days of being on it I wasn&039;t having any more diarrhea. After about a week the cramping went away. I still need to watch what I eat, (not too much dairy, wheat, etc) but this makes it to where I can at least enjoy a meal without having to run to the bathroom 12 times a day. I&039;ve had, I&039;d say 3 &quot;flare ups&quot; in between starting this and now. Which are not even near as bad as they were without this medicine.','I&039;ve been taking this medicine for over a year now. I have no side effects and it effectively gets rid of my pain. I&039;m in no way addicted to or have anything bad to say about this medicine. It helps my back pain a great deal. I was taking oxycodone for 1 1/2 years before my spine specialist put me on this medication. I love that I&039;m not tired and can do things again. Without it, I can&039;t even get out of bed and that&039;s no exaggeration I promise you. It&039;s done wonders for my back and the Lyrica has done wonders for the nerve pain in my leg.','This medicine is a joke. They want to take you off Percocet and hydrocodone and put you on this medicine which is supposed to be longer acting. But I&rsquo;d rather take six Percocet 10 mg a day then one of these.

I take 25mg. in the morning, and 25mg. about 11 hours later. The medicine has stopped my PVC&039;s, and also slows down my heart rate. When I first started taking Metoprorlol Tartrate, it made me very tired, but after about 2 weeks, my body got used to it, and I was fine.','I just started using this product and I like it already. I hope to see great results in the future.','This medicine worked for me except the side effect of swelling feet and ankles, and pain in the ankles. I stopped the medicine on my own due to the swelling.','* hopefully it will cure the ulcers and torn up stomach caused by antibiotics due to  infection from kitten bite.

I&039;ve taken it probably too much but for good reason. I don&039;t do well with birth control pills and am not always in a relationship. Since 2009, this pill has been effective for me. I weigh more than the recommended weight and have had sex during my fertile days. While I&039;m not a medical professional, I do take a lot of vitamin c and parsley to get my period early to ease my stress.

My morning sickness was horrendous, and this is the only thing that made me feel great','I would like to lodge a complaint. I came in for surgery on 12-17-16. I told the anesthesiologist that I did not want memory blocking drugs. He told me I would be given Propofol which was fine with me I had that before with good results. When I woke up in the recovery room and was having issues blurred vision, double vision, sensation of spinning, and loss of balance; my husband stated this had not happened before with Propofol.  I was told I was given Versed (a memory blocking drug). We were told the procedure went well, so I do not know why this side-effect inducing drug was administered. I was sent home while very unsteady on my feet with sensation of spinning, and loss of balance. I do not believe it was safe to discharge me in that condition. Indeed my husband called my son to help him get me into the house. Most of all I feel my trust was violated, and my wishes were not followed while I was in a vunerable position, and this greatly concerns me. Next time do I need to request that my husband stay with me through the complete procedure for my own protection from the staff?','I have used this pill twice. My boyfriend and i have been havjng unprotected sex for about 2 yrs. We usually use condoms and sometimes we do it without one. The first time i took the pill we weren&039;t sure if he had came in me. I took it the next morning and had no symptoms at all. Got my period on time. This is the second time i take Plan B. I took it after 30 mins of having sex.  And a week later im getting the worst cramps ever. I hope it works because I&039;m stressing out.','I would recommend any one to give this Champix a try.

However, just one Cipro pill makes the pain just disappear I have no known side effect from Cipro. Cipro is simple awesome','So I took plan b and it definitely worked, BUT the pain afterwards was TERRIBLE. The pain didn&039;t start until after a couple weeks I right before my period. The pain I had in my stomach was a pain I never felt before I couldn&039;t even eat. As soon as I swallowed food it was pain I couldn&039;t eat for 3 days.

It works for me but I would start at a lower dose &amp; stay at a lower dose as long as I could. ','I developed Rosacea when I was pregnant with my first child (at age 39).  I never had skin issues before, even as a teenager.  I finally went to the doctor and was diagnosed with Papulopustular Rosacea (acne plus redness).  My doctor prescribed Monodox and it has worked WONDERS  Within a week, almost all the pimples/bumps were gone. GONE  I only hope that once I finish up the medication (60 days), it won&039;t all come back.  The downside is the cost.  Thankfully, my doctor gave me a discount card from the manufacturer that allows me to buy it for $10 per month.  Otherwise, it was $225 for 60 day supply.','I have been an MS patient since I was 17, I am 29 now, I have been using Avonex for 10 years now and am so happy with the results.  I take it before I go to bed at night on a weekend, I also take a couple of Tylenol with codeine (1) and usually only have a slight headache when I wake up in the morning.  I do get a lot of migraines, but who knows if that has anything to do with the medication or the fact that I have Multiple Sclerosis.  Avonex has worked wonders for me, I usually only have an MS attack on average every 3 to 4 years and they aren&039;t usually that severe.  I have relapsing and remitting MS.  I would recommend Avonex to anyone who is newly diagnosed.  It has changed my life.','I had the Skyla placed a month ago. My Doc said I would experience some slight cramping during insertion and light cramps throughout the evening. I haven&039;t had children &amp; have a tilted uterus; 2 odds against my favor. The doctor clamped my uterus, pulled it straight to allow for placement, &amp; manually dilated my cervix with another tool. The pain was excruciating. I was so miserable that I was holding my breath (accidentally) &amp; nearly passed out. She told me to take Ibuprofen for pain. After bawling my eyes out 45 mins driving home, I took Ibuprofen, but no help. I called the MD back and she said this was &quot;okay&quot; since I had a tilted uterus and never had children (bad answer). Now it&039;s been in for a month &amp; cramps are rare &amp; tolerable.','Had disc replaced L5- S1 with laminectomy plus 2 rods and 4 screws inserted, pain was unbearable while taking Vicodin.

I had behavior issues in my second grade class and I drove my teacher nuts with my constant distractions and my lack of focus. Little things like small talk and excessive noises triggered my symptoms and I was put on Ritalin LA when I was eight. Ritalin was awful for me. I didn&039;t sleep very well at all. I had periods of insomnia and when I would sleep it was very prolonged in hours of sleep I was getting. Finally, after a couple of years suffering with this Ritalin I talked with my doctor about trying a new medicine called Focalin XR when I was 13 and I am almost 18 now. Focalin XR has been really wonderful for me. My focus is better. It does cause diarrhea, and mood swings.','I&039;ve been using Alesse for about 2 years now. It was the first BC pill that I was prescribed. I was hesitant to use hormonal contraceptives because of mood swings and spotting. However with Alesse, I experienced neither of those side effects. I can&039;t say it made my skin any clearer. I don&039;t have severe acne but it didn&039;t clear up my pimples. One side effect I did experience was weight gain. I am normally about 105 pounds but on the pill I gain about 3-4 pounds. I just feel very bloated. However, when I stop the pill temporarily ( the week of my period) I go back to my regular weight. I realized I could manage this by just watching what I eat and I exercise a bit more. Overall, I am pretty satisfied with Alesse','Since being diagnosed with Epilepsy I was put on pills to prevent seizures which did not help until I was also put on Loestrin 24 Fe. So far no seizures. I believe its related to a hormonal imbalance and the Birth Control definitely helps. I have not had any bad symptoms at all. No nausea, no mood swings. I have tried every single Birth Control I could think of and this is the only one I like by far. I plan to stay on it for another 6-12 months and try for baby 3.','I was on the sertraline, for 3 years. After developing a strange phobia with severe anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and major depression, this medication probably saved my life. However, it only brought me back halfway. I still was depressed and still suffered from anxiety attacks, just not as much. After a couple of years, I believed it stopped working, even after increasing the dose, so I stopped taking it.','Only thing I can say about the Loestrin 24 FE is AWESOME.  I have been on these pills for 6yrs now and in the beginning my period lasted 2 to 3 days and as time went on it decreased even more and went to 24hrs and my period was over. Later on it changed again and I came on and was off in 12hrs.  Today, I haven&039;t had a period at all I know in yrs. I love these pills but the only downfall is even though I don&039;t come on I still have the mood swings, irritating moments, feeling strange, headaches etc. but at the time when my period would have been ending that&039;s when everything goes away. I did used to worry in the beginning when I completely stopped having a period but now I know its just the way these pills are with my body.','My daughter had great symptom control, but developed urinary and fecal incontinence after being on it for over a year.  Back to looking for the next best medication.','For me, who is about to be 40 years old, I found that I had a shorter fuse than normal, couldn&039;t finish anything, no energy, no focus. Went in to talk with a doctor and he tested me and found that I too was ADHD. I cannot tell you that I was shocked.  He said it was bad enough to warrant 36mg starting point.  I started it on a Thursday and by Sunday I had lost 6 lbs already.  Not that I didn&039;t like losing that much but not the way it happened.  I have been so nauseated.  Now, days are not too bad but I feel like I am crashing at night and also very nauseated at night still. I cannot take this anymore. I will actually go back to the way I was, before I will keep up with this.  For my son at 81mg a day. It is absolutely FANTASTIC for him.','Continued: I experienced some breast tenderness and slight breast growth (I ain&039;t complaining about that) I&039;m currently in my second pack and experiencing no side effects at all I am very happy with this medication and impressed with how well it worked out for me despite all the negative reviews. Don&039;t let the reviews frighten you, everyone&039;s BODY&039;S are different so try it out for yourself :) good luck','I chose Mirena because I was having heavy periods with severe cramping along with terrible acne/pms symptoms. I am 27 years old and have never had children. I was very nervous before the procedure because of reading many terrible reviews. First off placement was the most painful experience thus far. Not even exaggerating.  I&039;ve got a very high pain tolerance and I thought I was going to pass out. I left the office in some serious pain/cramping and it continued for about a day. I spotted for about a week along with minor cramps. It&039;s now been 2 months and I have not had any spotting/cramping or periods My mood is better and for the first time in 10 years I haven&039;t had any acne breakouts. Also zero weight gain I love Mirena, best choice ever.','It makes any impossible situation more possible, it controls violence rage temper anger towards others. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, panic attacks and keeps you calm.  The best','It&039;s amazing how many symptoms come about because of anxiety: chest pain, chest squeezing, dizziness, light-headed feelings, feeling faint, sweating, nausea, heart palpitations. I could go on. Xanax is practically a miracle drug. It stops most of these symptoms cold after about 45 minutes of taking it. You feel better, and you look back at one hour ago, and you&039;re bewildered that stress and anxiety caused you to feel so badly.','After taking Chantix for smoking cessation I fell into a spiral of severe d&egrave;pression. I didn&039;t feel like leaving my home other than going to work  I gained 25 pounds and felt my life was hopeless   I had always felt like an extrovert trapped in an intraverts body. I stumbled upon  Valium when my husband gave me one for muscle cramps. The effects were amazing  I no longer felt trapped in I my prison of isolation and misery. A word of caution though: this drug is addictive and should be taken in small amounts and withdrawal should be done slowly and under medical supervision. It is a shame Valium has such a bad rap','I have been constipated for about a week and tried eating everything possible that will help me go even Mexican food and still nothing. I tried Miralax and couldn&039;t go so I tried chocolate laxatives and nothing and tried Dulcolax suppositories. I&039;m so beyond nauseated which is better than having cramps but I still feel constipated even though I went a little. At least the Dulcolax helped me go within minutes and I&039;m glad I was on the toilet when it happened.','Used the 3 day Monistat. Intense itching/burning as soon as I used the applicator. Worst pain I have ever felt. What the hell is Monistat trying to do? I&039;ve used before and it did not do this. I&039;m calling my Doctor for Diflucan. This stuff is awful.','I was diagnosed with GAD and PD, and then given this generic brand of Lexapro. Since this drug more potent than other SSRIs, I was relying on its efficiency to work quickly and with little side effects. I took 0.5mg of this every morning. The first two weeks I noticed an improvement in my mood. But I was feeling drowsy (a side effect) that made me lack energy and feel too foggy headed. By the third week, I was experiencing an increase in anxiety, extreme mood fluctuations, stronger feelings of fear, lack of appetite, and more symptoms of a panic attack. I talked to my therapist after 3 days of this continued torture and was advised to quit the Lexapro. It just isn&039;t for me. Everyone experiences SSRIs differently Keep looking','They switched me from Necon to Nortrel saying it was the &quot;same&quot;. Within the first week I knew it was bad for my body. My acne got worse and hurt, and my doctor said it should be helping my acne get better. Since I started 6 months ago with Nortrel I have had dry eyes and now I have a hard time seeing far away, which my eye doctor said is due to dry eyes since I have 20/20 vision. I was on Necon for 4 years and was so upset they switched me. I&039;m stopping the pill completely now and I&039;m worried about side effects of going off but it&039;s not worth the dry eyes and other bad side effects. Very disappointed.','Stops the pain.','I was on this pill after I finished breast feeding, and I had lots of problems with break-through bleeding, every month. I was on Lo Ovral for 9 years prior to having a baby and didn&039;t experience the problems I have with Loestrin. ','Did not help me go to sleep but relaxed me. But  I got a headache that seemed to increase during my 10  day trial. I do not like it and will not get any more','I am very happy with Concerta. I am 17 years old and started taking this about 3 months ago. Before I took this, I had a lot of trouble in school with paying attention and focusing, and after I took it, I noticed an immediate difference and it was so much easier to focus and pay attention. Another really positive feedback from Concerta is that it helps me engage in conversation more because I am more focused and I don&039;t interrupt people like I used to. Also, it helps me think things through more.','Saved my life.','Taking this after care of breast cancer Hasn&039;t caused any problems at all and almost done taking it Evidently it&039;s great in the help of my breast cancer.','Been using Rogaine for about 4 months, experiencing scalp itch on the spot and behind my ears. Hope it goes away.','I started Bydueron 10 weeks ago.  I was fine the first 6 weeks.  On week 7, I became extremely ill.  Vomiting, explosive diarrhea, gas pains and bloating like never before, long flatulence every few minutes (how embarrassing), and sulfur-tasting belching (like rotten eggs).  Endo dr. said it wasn&039;t the med.  I went to my primary doctor because I wasn&039;t sure if it was a virus.  All of my tests came back negative.  Third week, same thing.  I decided not to take the injection and notified endo. She told me to stop metformin and resume shot.  Last week, had shot and condition worsened.  She finally told me to stop the injections.  It&039;s been four weeks of suffering.  Not worth it  This stuff is poison to me','After taking Risperidone for 6 months to relieve my panic, fear and irrational thoughts associated with my PTSD, I encountered very little relief. What I did gain was the WEIGHT. I gained 50 lbs in 6 months with no change in eating habits. After voicing this concern to my doctor, I was taken off the medication with no withdrawal effects and in 10 months time I lost 49lbs with no exercise and eating a healthier low glycemic index diet.','I have PTSD, OCD, severe bipolar and severe borderline personality disorder along with severe panic attacks and constant anxiety. I was taken off of 0.5 mg Xanax taken four times a day over 25 years which enabled me to live a &quot;normal&quot; life. I was prescribed klonopin instead. While it does help tremendously with the panic and anxiety, for me anyway, Xanax worked much better. I am on a slew of other meds for the other disorders I have. Just commenting on klonopin','I was on Sprintec for 5 months as my first birth control ever, and overall I liked it. Shorter periods, less cramps, great skin, so cheap, and never any spotting (only when I skipped my period on purpose, I spotted a week later for 2 weeks). Only problem is I gained about 15 pounds and my breasts got HUGE. Mine were already big and kept growing so I had to switch to a lower dose.  I would definitely recommend this birth control to anyone.','Why would one take a medication for abdominal pain when one of the side effects is abdominal pain.','I&039;ve only been on this form of birth control for less than 2 weeks, but so far so good It&039;s my first form of the pill I&039;ve taken and I feel just normal as ever Only it&039;s nice to not have to worry about creating a little human all the time, since I am very sexually active, being married and all. I take it at 8 am every day. I wanted to add this because lots of reviews on here say they take it at night and feel horrible all night or next morning. So maybe that&039;s because they take it at night? Of course I don&039;t know. But they say not to take this pill on bed rest or anything, so maybe. I&039;ll keep ya&039;ll updated if anything bad happens. But so far I&039;m lovin it','I take Risperdal to treat my schizophrenia, but I also suffer from paranoia. I know Risperdal is not used to directly treat my paranoia, but it&039;s done nothing for my schizophrenia either. The voices and hallucinations are still prominent.','I&039;ve been taking Ocella for 4 months, and so far everything is going great.  I feel normal, my period comes on time every month, and my period is not as heavy.  Occasionally, I feel nauseous around my period, but that side-effect occurs with or without birth control.  I would recommend this oral contraceptive to anyone who is between late teens and early twenties.','I started Augmentin on Thursday morning because I had typhoid. My doctor insisted it will clear it and make me feel better.  Since Thursday,  I have experience extreme diarrhea,  nausea,   and body pains.  I wake up 8 -10 times during the night to vomit and stool.  Both happens simultaneously and as at this morning of the fourth day,  I feel like I might never get better. I am going to stop it. I have no more strength to even puke or sit up.  I can&039;t lie on my belly or back either and my two sides are aching seriously due to the constant support','I took quasense for about 3 years and the first two years I loved it. I have tried at least 4 birth controls (oral contraceptive form) and this one was the first to finally work for me. However, within the past year I have had some awful things happening to me and my obgyn thinks it is due to the estrogen in the pill. I had a weight gain of 7 pounds within a week &amp; a half. During this time I was exercising &amp; barely eating to try and get back down to my normal weight. However I only continued to gain weight. I have had so much hair loss this year &amp; now have 4 distinct bald spots. Crazy mood swings, I&039;ve had my period for 2 months straight now, &amp; I&039;m extremely tired. Today I had the IUD &quot;skyla&quot; inserted so I hope everything improves soon :(','I am 24 and for years I have struggled with my weight. It wasn&039;t super serious until I got in a relationship- I gained nearly 40kg in under a year. At my heaviest I was 116kg. I see a personal trainer, go to Zumba, and I thought I was eating well- nothing helped me shed the weight. I got tested for thyroid issues and PCOS- neither explained my inability to shed the Kgs.  I started this drug about 17 days ago. My starting weight was 106.7kg- I now weigh 100.4kg. It has completely changed how I view food, what I crave, and made me realise that whilst the foods I was previously eating were good foods, I was eating far too much because my body had forgotten how to recognise true hunger. I am so excited- it is so worth the money. 10/10','Have been on the patch for 5 months now &amp; it&039;s just awful, I feel nauseous all the time &amp; get headaches and the dizziness that comes along with it. My periods are heavy &amp; have painful cramping, some in between bleeding','Ladies, please be smart and use BC and condoms Plan B does not stop a pregnancy if egg fertilization has occurred.   I recently took a plan B 24 hours after having sex, but it was too late. Plan B unfortunately didn&039;t work for me. Take immediately if you suspect you might be pregnant (don&039;t wait)an most importantly use all methods of BC','Well, it has been about 12 days since I have taken my first shot of Simponi. I started on Saturday, August 29, 2009. I also stopped taking prednisone that day. I feel real good. I go to the Doctor on the 23rd of September. I would like to start cutting back on the methotrexate. I will update next month.  ','Caused me to have very bad headaches. Light sensitivity. Dizziness.','Of any generic, Endocet seems to work the best. I always request it when filling my prescription.','I had a terrible case of Chronic Prostatitis caused by enterococcus. All antibiotics that this bacteria was sensitive to would not enter the protaste gland properly. My doctor prescribed 6 others antibiotics before Avelox. Thank God Avelox killed this nasty infection.    I had to take it for 6 weeks. After the second week I was feeling normal again (after 10 months of fighting). Magic little red pills.','After 3 years of astounding results from Supartz, I had to miss injections due to having ObamaCare where my policy was not accepted by my Ortho MD for 15 months.  Medicare is accepted and I returned for my semi-annual injection series wherein he told me he has seen slightly better results with Euflexxa.  After the first injection, I noticed significant swelling associated with an increase in pain from zero to 3.  After the second injection, the swelling had increased and pain worsened to a 6 with my inability to climb stairs.  The third injection was followed by a steroid to help reduce the swelling and an infection was ruled out. I am now scheduled for an MRI.  Supartz works, Euflexxa does not.','This is an AMAZING product.  I STRONGLY RECOMMEND TRYING IT.  Truly a must try.','This is my miracle. I was put on it in Germany and had to go off it until I had insurance again. I suffer from depression and anxiety. Often I would find myself stuck in a daydream world because of all the things going on in my life, including my partner of years (15-25). I would have no energy and just feel so low. Finally I had insurance and was put on 1800mg a day. I feel so much better. I feel like I can handle life and set goals for myself. I don&039;t feel anxiety. I don&039;t sit here and think of the negative and focus on a positive life. I am more fun and interactive with my son.   It literately saved my life. I don&039;t know why.','During a migraine attack, I took a Dramamine to help me sleep (as, yes, it packs a wallop in the drowsy department). It did make me a little drowsy, but what was more interesting is that my migraine went from a &quot;10&quot; to a &quot;4&quot; on the pain scale. Now when I start to get migraine symptoms, I take an Excedrin and a Dramamine. The combination works tremendously for me.','After 2 days of taking this I got blurred vision.','I waited to start until today, since I am off work today. I&039;ve never been on a prescription before. (Outside of antibiotics for cold, flu..etc.) I didn&039;t feel anything until around an hour. My throat got extremely dry and I had an insatiable thirst. I drank glass after glass of water for at least two hours. (I also had to use the restroom every 10/15min, which is a concern for days I have to work. I drive long distances for work) At the second hour I had a crazy burst of energy and started deep cleaning my entire house. After I finished, I felt tired so I laid in my bed. I was in it for 30-45min, but could not go to sleep. I got up and ate two pizza slices, which is normal for me. I guess it takes a while before your appetite is suppressed.','Terrible flavor  Works good if you can actually finish the first dose.  Dreading the second dose','I am almost finish with my first bottle. I had no side effects. My appetite increased instead of decreasing. I am debating about getting another bottle.','I have found Metrocream to be very effective in combating symptoms of rosacea, especially the pimple like lesions I get around my nose &amp; chin area.  I use only when needed and notice after just a couple of applications a dramatic improvement.','I struggled with symptoms of PMDD for a while and finally my doctor put me on Aviane to regulate my hormone levels and thus, mood. Aviane made my breasts larger but increased my acne and oily skin like crazy and made me more depressed and emotional I normally have clear skin, so the acne was horrible for me. I asked to switch to Ortho-Tri Cyclen Lo. Since I&039;ve taken OTC-Lo (for 6 months), I&039;ve noticed my skin cleared up (although I still have minor acne compared to when I was off the pill), and it helped with my mood swings tremendously. Although a bit more pricey ($15 copay), I am very happy with the improvement in mood that OTC-Lo has given me, which is a much better gain compared to the minor acne I am still experiencing.','I have been on this medicine for almost a month now. I have not experienced ANY side effects. Before I started it, I saw all these comments and they nearly scared me. My doctor assured me that if I had not felt any side effects on the birth control pills I was on before, that I would be fine. She was right, imagine that. Now obviously I have yet to have my period, we will see how that goes in another 2 months. I was on Loestrin 24 FE before this one, but it started to not work for my period anymore. So far, not a problem with Seasonique.','Ibuprofen was my default pain relief early in my experience with Ankylosing Spondylitis. It reduced inflammation and made the pain, discomfort and stiffness more manageable.   I did experience some side effects (constipation, followed by diarrhea due to the blockage, stomach pains etc., but the pain management helped to make it bearable. I managed on it for over 10 years before my fusion made the pain worse.','I was diagnosed with severe painful and silent migraines a few months ago, but the neurologist said I&039;ve most likely suffered from silent migraines my entire life (I&039;m 17 by the way), but recently they have started getting painful. Imitrex was the first medication I was put on. I was excited to start feeling better, but imitrex made me feel awful. I suffer from extreme nausea before, during and after a migraine and it&039;s completely life ruining. I&039;ve tried imitrex many times, in hopes of it finally working. Every time I&039;d take it, I&039;d get a horrible burning in my throat, and my migraine would worsen. It didn&039;t help nausea, aura, pain or any other migraine symptoms I suffer from. I&039;ve recently been put on another medication that&039;ll hopefully work.','I am 22, no prior children, I have endometriosis &amp; was told Mirena was the best option. The implementation process was hell. The worst pain I have ever been in. I fainted &amp; had to have a friend pick me up. I left it in for 10 months. Within those 10 months I&039;d gained 18 pounds (on a 5 foot tall person that&039;s horrible), I was moody, had the worst cramps, hair loss, acne, horrible headaches, the appetite of a sumo wrestler, &amp; didn&039;t want to do anything. I felt lazy and borderline depressed. They don&039;t tell you those side effects for obvious reasons. Yesterday I finally had it removed. Being traumatized by having it put in I about made myself sick with nerves. The removal was quick and painless and I already feel like myself again.','I take opiates every day, and a side effect of this is severe constipation. I would often go weeks without having a bowel movement. When I did go, it was painful and required a lot of work and time. I have tried other solutions and MiraLax is the best by far. I took one cap full every day and on the second day I had a small bowel movement. I kept taking it and the very next day I had the first normal bowel movement in years. No cramping, no straining and no pain. I cannot recommend MiraLax enough. It is so gentle, yet works so well If you suffer with constipation don&039;t suffer anymore Try MiraLax','I&039;ve read a lot of reviews on this pill, and I agree with the reviews that reflect negative side effects. I believe every woman is different, and my chemistry doesn&039;t work well with this pill. I&039;ve been on it for five months, and I can&039;t wait to switch. I&039;ve noted breast tenderness, weird cramping, severe mood swings (laughing and crying at the same time while watching commercials; that was odd), my period doesn&039;t occur in the normal cycle time, and I&039;ve gained a significant amount of weight. It probably works well with some women, but not for me.','Fast acting for chronic pain, the ONLY downside is a shorter time period of relief then other pain medications.','I am 21 years old, non-smoker, do not drink often, exercise regularly (aka. poster child of health, I was a college athlete as well...I don&039;t even have a cavity) I recently got diagnosed with DVT (blood clot in leg) and a pulmonary embolism.  I was on Junel FE and the 3 doctors I saw said it was due to the birth control.  DO NOT TAKE THIS  I know it is considered a &quot;rare&quot; side effect, but it can happen to you easily.  Apparently it is not as rare as I thought.  The medication is VERY costly and you may have to be on blood thinners for the rest of your life. Be careful.','Went to the doctor to help with a clonidine taper. Clonidine was prescribed for methadone withdrawal along with Valium. Got off the methadone pretty easy considering how messed up I was. Now stuck with physical clonidine addiction after being on it for 3 months.  Was prescribed propranolol for day time control of rebound high blood pressure and withdrawal anxiety and so far it is working amazingly. I feel like I could talk in front of 100,000 people and not flinch in fear. Because propranolol has its own withdrawal if you are on it too long just like clonidine but at least this time I am aware of the possibility rather than blindly taking some medication.','I was on Loestrin 24 Fe for about 6 months and never had any problems emotionally. However, I gained about 10 pounds and my acne that had never been bad became extremely severe. And it&039;s now slowly going away.','Well, I&039;ve been taking orlistat for 6 days three times a day, already lost 1 kg. Although I have a headache and am slightly constipated, I am happy I have found something that works.','I&039;ve been on Copaxone for 2 years, and symptoms have gotten worst.  I guess there&039;s a reason the side effects make it so appealing to everyone.  My doctor is finally changing it to another medicine, unfortunately due to severe liver side effects.  I am in so much pain and fatigue everyday, I&039;ve lost so much of my life, my job, my social life.  Trying to overcome this monster.','I have been taking Celebrex now for a little over 30 days. I am 30 years old and have suffered from chronic arthritis pain for over 10 years. I have had two ankle surgeries leaving me with what feels like no relief. My last surgery was over 2 years ago and did provide SOME relief but not completely. Since I?ve been on Celebrex I can honestly say it?s been a blessing in disguise I went from 2-3 days a week of pain and discomfort to virtually none.','I had been taking Xanax and Lexapro for generalized anxiety disorder. The Xanax, at 0.25 mg, made me a zombie. Atarax at 50 mg 3 times a day works very well for me and I am able to function at work as well. The sedative effects wore off after a few days.','I had been taking anti-anxiety medication for a very long time due to my severe anxiety and panic attack disorder I have and the last resort after trying a few others was to take klonopin 1 mg 4 times a day.. After starting taking the medication, I didn&039;t notice any bad side effects, but then I slowly started to have nightmares and night terrors, even when I just took small cat naps It was absolutely horrible, I couldn&039;t stand it but I didn&039;t think about Klonopin being the cause until after a while it stopped working for my anxiety and I went back to Xanax which started to work better for me again and all of a sudden, my night terrors have disappeared and no longer afraid to fall asleep They&039;ve gone away ever since I stopped Klonopin.','I took two pills along with 4 teaspoons of Castor oil about 2.5 hours ago.  Still waiting.  Hoping I didn&039;t screw up to bad by taking both, and two dulcolax pills...we will see','I have been on this pill for 7 months and it is good except for the extreme nausea and it causes me to not want to eat sometimes. So I have lost weight except in my boobs which actually stayed at my normal C cup. If you have anxiety and anxiety attacks like I do just know that any hormonal birth control can make them more frequent.','Gave myself the first injection using the Pen earlier this week.  The injection was automatic. Pressed it against my skin, pushed the button, the mechanism clicked and the injection was made.  When finished the mechanism clicked again which withdrew the needle. It was almost painless. Will repeat in two weeks and get blood tests in a few months to see if it works.','I&039;ve been on Junel Fe for 9 months now. For the first three months I experienced nausea and occasional mood swings, it helped with making my period lighter and regularly on time. After the first months I was fine. Upon month 8 I experienced extreme mood swings and depression. I would pick fights about the smallest things and I felt crazy for doing so. I became really depressed once I hit month 9 and just could not figure out what was going on. Finally, a friend suggested getting off of Junel Fe and I have seen immediate change in my mood even on day 3 of being off the pill. Did not work for me.','After getting shot in my lower back, my back got torn apart. It took 7 surgeries, and the pain is unexplainable. It&039;s not 10/10 pain, It&039;s more like 20/10 pain. My PM doctor put me on Methadone 10mg 4x daily,  and Oxycodone 30mg 6x daily. Those are 2 of the strongest Pain meds out there. Now my pain level is about a 5/10. Big improvement. The Methadone helps A LOT. I was first put on Fentanyl 50mcg patch along with the Oxy, my pain then was 8/10.. still too much pain. After getting switched to Methadone with the Oxy.. huge difference. Methadone is the best Painkiller I&039;ve ever tried. TY Methadone.','This pill did not work for me. After three days  I started noticing severe mood swings, mostly between irrational anger and despondency. My perfectly clear skin also started to breakout, I could never feel satiated (not necessarily hungry but still snacking all the time), unable to fall asleep, and had horrible constipation. I went off the pills and a week later still have most of the side effects, although my insomnia has improved. Definitely not for everyone, hoping it will get out of my system soon','I&039;ve had the implant in for 2 years today - and I&039;m hoping to have it taken out tonight, I&039;ve not really had any major problems with the implant, I only have a period for about a week every 3 months so I&039;m fine with that, however I have put weight on and can&039;t get it off at all, I go to the gym and eat healthy and I only end up putting more weight on Also, ever since having the implant I&039;ve had thrush (yeast infection) about 3 times, and the doctors say it can&039;t be because of the implant however I&039;m certain it is. I&039;m always constantly moody and I never even want sex so I&039;m hoping to have it out just so I can be myself again. I wouldn&039;t have one put in again just because it&039;s so long to put up with but if you&039;re happy being moody for 3 years then go for it.','Helped a ton post-partum. Suffered depression long after both my babies were born. Insomnia is common and I took sleep aids for the first year. Any tiny disturbance in taking it is NOT RECOMMENDED...Worst I have ever felt.  The &quot;brain zaps&quot; are like a special kind of torture and my appetite is simply non existent...not good for someone already under weight.  It saved me for a long time but the choice to come off was heavily weighed against the withdrawal symptoms. I am suffering through it a week later. Anxiety getting better but physically there is not much change.','Not once but twice woke up during 2 separate procedures for colonoscopies, with doctors trying to force air out.   Drug is way too mild.','I am on my 3rd Mirena (replaced every 5 years). Every insertion has been excruciatingly painful; this last time, dare I say was WORSE I was teary-eyed, breathing through it while also screaming intermittently as my dr inched it into place; and for whatever reason, I felt the pain on my right side. I fully expected spotting &amp; cramps for a few days after. Here I am now, just under 4-weeks later, with cramping and spotting almost daily. The cramps are on my right side, which is where the pain was during insertion. I have never had a problem before now. I&039;ve used Mirena for over 10 years &amp; have always loved it. I just turned 40, so I&039;m wondering if my body is responding differently due to hormonal fluctuations that come with age.','I am a 42 yr old mother. I have been depressed all of my life. Never been happy more than a few weeks at a time. I have tired a few different mess but no real change. I would also self medicate with alcohol. At least once a week I would get to drunk I would black out. As you probably figured that caused a lot of problems in itself. I started taken Brentellix 6 moths ago and I have NEVER been so happy in my entire life I love it It really changed my life for the better. No more drinking At all. I&039;m so happy and my family has also seen the change are are more happy.','No problems - at first had great sex drive, 4 day periods, no cramps, light. No headaches or mood changes like with other birth control pills. The pills are not expensive. Did have a lot of yeast infections every month on the time of my period. Stopped taking it because my sugar got high and blood pressure was high. If you are a diabetic or have high blood pressure you have to be monitored by your doctor. This pill was not for me but every body is different. ','I love this birth control because no spotting between periods. A little emotional from the birth control. No mood swings. My last birth control made me bleed constantly every month so I stopped taking it and then I got pregnant and then I went on this birth control and I could be happier. I just wish it wasn&039;t so expensive.','I had been on Lexapro/Celexa/Citolopram for the past 10 years (maybe a couple more) and it was fabulous  About a year and half ago it stopped working for me.  I had tried Wellbutrin before the L/C/C and it was horrible for me - like wanting to hide in a corner under a desk paranoia  My doctor sugested Viibryd after the L/C/C stopped working and so far so good.  I can&039;t attest to the GI problems, and I don&039;t know if I have the night time issues (I sleep like a log and am single so no one is there to tell me what is going on while I&039;m sleeping).  I do have sleep issues, but not related to Viibryd.  I have found that the Viibryd doesn&039;t help with anxiety/anger issues, so the doctor suggested adding L-Theanine and that helps tons','Have smoked for 12 years,  I was smoking a 40 pack (Australia) in less than 24 hrs.  I went on Champix and after 2 weeks I was a non smoker and no side effects.   Normally I&039;d be clawing at the walls of my house if I didn&039;t have a cigarette for a hour, now my cigarette addiction is comparable to eating chocolate, I&039;d like some but I can go without.  I also have ADHD which makes smoking a lot more pleasurable and a lot more addictive.','I love that I only have to think about my birth control twice a month. It&039;s easy to use. That being said, after about six months of use, I realized that I was noticeably more anxious, depressed, and emotional. Where I&039;ve had problems with anxiety before, I more frequently have panic attacks, a rapid heartbeat, and a tight chest. I find it hard to fall asleep at night, and hard to get out of bed in the morning. Maybe the worst part is that I have a very low libido. There will be times when I do have a desire to have sex with my SO, but my body doesn&039;t respond or tenses up quickly. Otherwise, I don&039;t think about intercourse nearly as much as I used to.','Temporal lobe w/ Mesial temporal sclerosis. Using 8 weeks. Sometimes headaches or dizzy, frequent minor muscle tremors and twitching, shortened menstrual cycle, sensitive mood. Always tired and not very productive, sleep more. Went from monthly 2-5 day blackout seizure binge with 2-5 day recovery, so far only 1 minor convulsion while conscious with mostly full recovery by morning. Major improvement.','I had possible Strep throat. First day I took it my fever rose to over 102. I was shaking, chills, rash.  My blood pressure (and I have high blood pressure) was 100/55 and my pulse was 50, I was not feeling well at all. I called doctor next morning and he switched me to Amoxicillin. I hope it works better.  Now I have a under the skin rash all over and am itching.  Guess I am allergic to this one.','This medication completely changed my life for the better.  Also having a thyroid autoimmune disease, menopause was worse for me, a bad endocrine &quot;cocktail&quot; as it were, and I was for almost a year brought to my knees with 20 or more knee buckling hot flash episodes a day that caused so much joint and limb pain I couldn&039;t walk, severe depression, was nearly bedridden from lack of energy and episodes that were almost anxiety attacks (never had them before).  Within 3 weeks of taking FemHrt, it nearly all ceased.  I got my life back.','I am a 28 year old female and my highest weight was 217 lb I am very active and work out 4 times a week at least but suffer from hashimotos thyroid along with Ibs-c. I have been to a handful of Specialists over the course of 10 years and used to have to run 2 hours a day just to keep my weight stable. My doctor recently added T3 to my regular levothyroxin everyday and I noticed more energy but my weight still clung on. She started me on a two-week trial of Qsymia (while trying to get approval from my insurance company) the first few days I felt foggy and very thirsty. I am now on day 11 and dropped 7 lbs still working out the same I never had much of an appetite and don&039;t eat many fatty foods which is why we looked into this medication','I was violently sick from taking this. Sure, it relieved the constipation but at one point I was debating whether I need 911.  Product: Bisacodyl USP 5 mg, marketed as CVS Brand Women&039;s Gentle Laxative. I am a middle-aged female, about 135lbs, no health probs. Yesterday I took one tablet in the afternoon. At 8 PM I felt nauseous, some abdominal rumbling. 8:30PM I vomited so hard that I actually wet myself. That was followed by wave after wave of violent abdominal pain. I was sweating so heavily that I stripped off all of my clothes, and so weak that I just laid on the bathroom floor in misery. I vomited again, then had diarrhea. Again at midnight. Again at 2AM. Finally recovered around 5AM. It was a nightmare and I would never take it again','It has always helped me with my lower back pain.','I have been on Contrave for 3 weeks. I am 5&quot;5, at 155 pounds. I think I have only lost 2 pounds. I work out with a personal trainer 3x a week and usually take long walks for other days not with trainer. My doctor recommended this prescription for me because I sit at a desk 10 hours a day and am typically very hungry and unable to stop my snacking. So far, I still crave foods. Not sure when the &039;appetite supressant&039; part will kick in, because it still has not done that. I have not noticed much differences so I will give it a little more time (until I finish the entire bottle supply) before asking DR. to change me to something else.','Nuvaring has worked out great for me. The only side effect I experience a lot from is nausea. I could be starving and the smell of food disgusts me.','I&039;ve been prescribed this med for 4 times a day for 14 days I feel horrible ,the taste in my mouth is so nasty ,my urine is dark ,my Bowel movements look green and funny .has anyone experienced this?','My girlfriend and I had sex during her fertile period, the condom broke and we didn&039;t realize. She took the pill around 8 hours later and it worked, she got her period I have read in some journals that the pill may not work during the fertile period so be careful Anyhow for us worked :)','Still felt nauseous after being given this drug after surgery. I woke up extremely sick and vomiting. This was the third drug given to help combat these effects. I didn&039;t know I&039;d been given it but my heart started racing and concerned the nursing staff, and their concern made me anxious. I was so scared and paranoid about what was happening to me which I later found out was all because of this drug. They ended up flushing it out of my system.','I&039;ve only been using Nucynta for a couple of days, but so far it is working very well for me with very minimal side effects.  I have chronic sciatica and have been on and off of low does Hydrocodone for a couple of years now.  I&039;ve been taking 50mg of Nucynta 2-3 times a day.  This seems to work almost as well on the pain and just seems easier on my body.  It does make me a bit &quot;loopy&quot; and a little groggy, but no more than the hydrocodone.  I also have noticed that I&039;m not as hungry, which is not necessarily a bad thing  I will be interested to see how it works over time and whether it continues to work well over a period of time.','Took medication for 7 days only side affect I had was  that I couldn&039;t have sex for 7 days :(','I used the medication for one month and during that time my face broke out in acne, and I have not been able to get the acne to go away in a year.','I had excruciating lower back pain along with sciatica. Had shot I hip about 4 hrs ago. Pain is almost gone. I still have a little sciatica, but that takes a few days to heal . Dr also prescribed Vicodin but don&039;t think I will need it tonight. I could barely walk before the dr visit. Now I am much better. No drug works for everyone, but it&039;s worth a try. Hope you all feel better','I was signed up to have the gastric sleeve procedure done but cancelled a few days prior wanting to try again to lose the weight on my own. I was 245 pounds March 28th and am 5&039;5. I started Phentermine shortly after that. I am currently 209lbs and it is July 22nd. Very happy with the results. Glad I didn&039;t have the operation even if I would be skinner now the risks were just too scary for me to go through with it. I would love to get down to 160lbs I am going to keep chugging along.','I have always taken Bactrim for a UTI and it has always worked with zero side effects.  I took two every 12 hours for ten days and I&039;m perfectly fine now.  ','Started effexor 75 in Oct start feeling fantastic beside dry mouth and a bit of nausea. Doctor up it to 150mg in November. I felt like a whole different person I got my life back but due to some side effects of the drug causing constipation and facial twitching in my lower lip and body jolts doctor tried to ween me off 150 mg taking one pill every second day it was too fast to soon. Wow just as well if I had done it cold turkey. Brain zaps, crying, feeling lost in my own body. Scared tremors.  It has been almost 2 weeks with no effexor and I have got vertigo, felt like I was going to die.  Today I started taking 150mg again today and already feel a difference. This could be my drug huge difference in mood ,zapping  gone and dry mouth is back I can live with that .','I had a great experience with this medication.  I had to go off all medication for a while but will ask for this again when I can resume. My doctor gave me Concerta and I didn&039;t think it was doing anything.  I felt calmer, the way you feel after a well rested vacation, but that was all the difference I felt. THEN my co-workers started complimenting me on my work more, saying I was doing much better (They were the ones that suggested I get tested for ADHD).','I am a mother of 5 and this is the second time round using the Implanon. The first time was much like this time round no period, weight gain from 75kg to 120 kg, mood swings, migraines. I&039;m sure I had the whole package but in saying that, ladies...you should always read the information &quot;inside the pack&quot;. It tells you what you might experience and its pretty much what everyone is stating. You may or might not get it. You won&039;t truly know until you try it for yourself.','Saved my  Life. I went from level 10 pain daily to almost no pain after the first infusion. I cry when I talk about how this medication as given me a whole new lease on life. It has literally saved my life.     My pain was so bad in my wrists that I couldn&039;t do anything anymore. I was seriously thinking about suicide or just cutting my hands off. I&039;m saved and I thank Remicade for it.','I am taking this for C-diff.  The medicine stopped the diarrhea after 3 days, but the medicine has made me sick to where I feel nauseous all the time.  I was very sensitive to light as well.  I have a 14 day supply and am on day 12.  The taste is horrible and have gagged several times because it would get stuck in my throat.  I am a baby when it comes to taking pills, but this has definitely been my worst experience.  Just hope I am all cleared up when I go for my follow up visit.  I am a 41 year old female and had bloody mucus in my stools which is what made me finally go to the doctor.  I had previously taken an antibiotic for a sinus infection which most likely caused the c-diff.','Without this medicine I could not sleep through the pain.','Being that I have rheumatoid arthritis and take medication for that, finding antibiotics to treat infection isn&039;t easy. I did not have many side effects from this medicine, as I took it how the doctor prescribed. I did have upset stomach though at first. Any infection I had, showed definite improvement within the first 36 hrs.','It is too bad that doctor&039;s are so freaked out about addictive behavior to the point where they are willing to let people suffer.  Valium in low dose works and this is just junk.  It may work for some but even results using test rats I have seen state they have low results.   I resent it when a person really needs help for acute conditions and they are given this kind of low performing medication.','After 15 years of Prostate Problems many Biopsies. PSA 139 had acute Urinary Retention and Catherised (not getting Catheter in, bleeding. Put on Duodart slight Improvement, nocturnal from ten times to about 4 to 5 times, very dizzy.','After about 7 years of struggling with severe, sometimes even deeply cystic acne on my face and shoulders, my dermatologist finally convinced me to try Accutane. I had been on at least 10 different topical and oral medications beforehand and nothing helped at all until I went on a 6 month Accutane regimen. It gets a little worse before it gets better, but I&039;m on my last month now and I&039;m 100\% CLEAR It&039;s so wonderful However the medicine is really drying, especially on your lips and eyes (plus I wear contacts). You need to apply lip balm almost constantly but it&039;s worth it in the end Also my arms dried out and were red and flaky for a few weeks, but a drugstore lotion cleared that up quickly. I would highly recommend Accutane to anyone','I started taking armour in November 2015.  The first couple of days I felt more tired. But after 4-5 days, I wasn&039;t tired throughout the day.  I lost 6 lbs in that month.  But then when I started my refill, all the weight came right back on.  Is it possible for a whole batch to be bad??  Or did my body regulate to that dose?','The drug Plaquenil was used faithfully for three months for the treatment of sarcoidosis. My scalp was ozing, flaking and overwhelmed with hyperpigmented lesions. The hair was approximately 1/4 inch in length due to the severity of the outbreak. My scalp has healed and the hair is now 6 inches long. The Plaquenil allowed my scalp to resume normal hair growth.','Had my left eye destroyed by a broomstick in a fight.  Doctor gave me percocet  What a joke, I was still in agony.  And Opana 10 ER did the trick.  ','This medication is a great sedative, if that&039;s what you&039;re looking for. It&039;s not euphoric, it just makes you sleepy.  But it caused me to gain over 40 pounds in less than 2 months.  I now get depressed just looking in the mirror.  My doctor says it just makes you hungry, not gain weight, but the amount of weight I gained in such a short time is unnatural','I never received any relief.Not sure if it even works. I followed directions, just awful product.','I have not been on it long enough. But it did control my diarrhea, not the pain. I was told because of my new diagnosis of Irritable Bowl Syndrome along with the Crohn&039;s Disease, they are stopping the infusions to see if the pain is not a side effect from it. This is all I know about it so far. I hope this helps a little.','I have been taking my first pack of Lo Loestrin Fe and I must say it really works for me. I was a little nervous at first because this is my first time taking birth control and I&039;ve heard all the negative side effects of taking birth control. I have had spotting [brown-ish color] for three weeks after my period, but that&039;s normal for the first month. I have breast tenderness and mood swings every now and then, then again it&039;s expected for the first few months. I have not yet experienced any weight gain. So far I am satisfied, but I wish it wasn&039;t so expensive.','This medication was by far the worst antidepressant have taken. The first month I seemed to do very well on it, after a year on it, I hit rock bottom mentally. It caused more terrible symptoms than what was beneficial to me. I had weird brain zaps that left me in bed for days, sleep disturbances, attention seeking behavior, as well as OCD that I had never experienced previously. It took forever to get off this terrible drug and I call it a terrible drug because your brain and body get physically addicted the way a street drug would, you miss 1 day and you start having severe withdrawals, sweats, extreme brain zaps, feeling out of touch w/reality/strange thoughts. After a month of being off Effexor, All of the bad stuff stopped.','Had a endoscopy and colonoscopy today.  They used propofol and I felt briefly drowsy then woke up in recovery.  Alert, but slightly unsteady while dressing. But it passed quickly and got out to the car fine. Would definitely have this drug used the next time.','I put off trying Chantix for three years because I feared all its horrible side effects. My doctor convinced me to give it a try. If I started to feel weird I could just stop taking it, he said. Well, while  I was waiting for the depression and nightmares to start, I quit smoking.  Cigarettes started to taste funny the first week. In the second week I was down to five or six . In the middle of the third week I went smoke free for the first time in twenty six years. My dreams are vivid not scary. I&039;m not depressed, I&039;m thrilled to be a non smoker. Dry mouth and constipation are really the only side effects I noticed. Try it. Don&039;t let someone else&039;s bad experience stop you from saving your own life.','I have been taking opiates for about 2-3 years and was taking about 20-30 tablets a day. I just started taking Suboxone today. I have to take two 8mg pills a day at first them go down I guess. Im really excited about this pill and can&039;t believe I feel this good. No withdrawl symptoms. I have energy and am able to actually do stuff without taking so many pills. ','I have taken various doses of trazodone for Fibromyalgia and insomnia. I can fall asleep but wake up 3 hrs later. I take  50-100mg and fall back to sleep. Finally a more restful sleep. Ahhh','I have a friend who had taken ambien for years without any problems. For whatever reason he had an episode where he took his pill and then remembers nothing until he was at the police station. He had drank three beers (which he only knows because that&039;s all that was in his frig) then proceded to drive () and ended up crashing into another parked car. This is scarey stuff, eh? It works wonderfully, but I surely wouldn&039;t want to have a blackout and end up driving. Is there any class action suit against this drug? I&039;ve heard of the other stories -- walking naked in the winter cold, eating while sleeping, and then my friend&039;s experience.','I have been using Mirapex for two years for severe RLS.  Mine just showed up suddenly without warning and honestly barely slept for two months.  I went to numerous doctors who tried every type of sleeping pill including Ambien. I still didn&039;t sleep and with the Ambien I actually got into my car and drove and don&039;t have much memory of it until I hit the back of another car  Finally I was placed on Mirapex and it is a miracle drug.  I literally was feeling suicidal until that was prescribed.  For me, it really needs to be taken early evening because if not I have problems because it takes awhile to take effect.','I had a bad attack of IC, and could not get a bladder irrigation for a few days, so took Uribel.It eased the pain. When I went for my normal swim, I could not catch my breath. I had brachycardia. I stopped taking the meds after a few days because the feeling of not being able to breathe properly was worrying me. It&039;s 5 or 6 days since I stopped taking it, and when I swam again, the situation was even worse. Tagamet is the only other medicine that has done this to me. I have to keep struggling, even now, sitting at home, to get enough of a breath. I wish the medicine would stop affecting me. I looked online to see what to do, or if brachycardia was listed as a side effect, but it isn&039;t. I am wondering what I should do to get back to normal.','I am writing on behalf of my partner who used the nasal spray to relieve a blocked nose, within two days of using she experienced severe flu like symptoms alongside a sore threat, light headedness and dizziness. The product only worked for a short period of time before returning her nose back to its blocked self.','I have chronic uti that have spread to kidneys and 2 times septic. 1-3 uti per month for last 4 years. Bactrim never worked...I am told it is used frequently for gram negative bacterias. Finally a University Hospital lab found it was gram negative E. Coli ESBL. Bactrim is not usually effective on ESBL.','Lo Lo Estrin Fe started out ok for me the first 3 months. I didn&039;t have a period and it was the best thing ever since my period is a nightmare for me before. Shortly after the 3 months I saw a difference in my body and weighed myself and I was 10 lbs heavier. Along with the weight gain I also suffered from horrible sporadic cramps and really bad acne. This is the worst birth control ever and I&039;m changing it ASAP','I don&039;t recommend it. Stay away from this shoot.','I have been using Propranolol for a few years for essential tremor (right hand) taking 20mg twice a day, however, shortness of breath and fatigue is now an issue and I am wondering now if the shakes are worth dealing with vs. shortness of breath and fatigue.  I have read that taking the pills during different times of the day make some changes which is something I may try.  I do quite a bit of presentation work and I find it does help with anxiety and stress of getting in front of people but I am now questioning the side affects as well as weight gain.  I walk three miles a day and believe me it is hard breathing but I am on the fence about which is the more questionable condition, shaking or difficulty breathing with fatigue.  What to do?','Rocephin is like a miracle I am always getting sick with ear infections, strep throat, and one shot is all it takes and with 2 to 4 hours I feel so much better.','Weight loss.   Glucose reduction , off insulin. Taking orals only.','I switched to this birth control from being on the depo,because I was doing fine till it was like my 3rd shot and I started to bleed and cramp so heavy then usual and nothing was stopping it so I switched to this birth control and so far everything was good till it hid the 3rd month mark and that&039;s when I&039;m started to spot and later on bleed. Which I still am at this point in time and it&039;s been a whole month now. At this rate I don&039;t think I want to be on birth control at all anymore if all I do is bleed.','I&039;ve been on this medication for just over 2 months now, taking 40mg a day. When I started on a low dose, the first 3 weeks I experienced severe dry skin, lips, and especially my nose and under my eyes even. The first 5 weeks my skin broke out worse. And from the beginning I started getting severe back pain. Now in week 9, my skin has settled down and is a tiny bit better, but all my blackheads have disappeared. My skin is still drier than usual, but it&039;s actually improved, and my lips are fine as long as I apply vaseline 2-3 times a day. The only significant side effect I still have is my back and bone/joint pain. So far I&039;m very happy with what I&039;ve achieved (the blackheads) and expect things to keep improving.','60 mg/day for 4 months and no relief of fibromyalgia symptoms. Killed my libido entirely and had trouble sleeping.','A friend told me told me to cut the sheets into quarters. So I did. I forgot to mention in my last post that I am 29 now.  Anyway, I have only take 2 quarters of a sheet today and I feel great.  No withdrawals and no thoughts or wants for pain pills.  I actually took 5 lortabs to work with me yesterday just in case the Suboxone did not work.  I was very comfortable with flushing them down the toilet this morning.  I am so thankful for Suboxone.  Life is already 100\% better and I am sure it will get better.  The only side effect is that it was difficult to go to sleep last night.  Suboxone is a life saver and I would recommend it to anybody.','I started Saxenda in on 11/9 Thursday. First dose .6 at the doctors office weighed in at 228.6. Got a headache immediately but went away that evening. Today is 11/11 Saturday I administer in the mornings. No side effects so far, except a little more energy.  I weighed my self today and 230.2. Way to early to judge, but my cravings for starch and sugar are gone and food is starting to look and taste weird. My food portion intake is definitely less almost a struggle to eat. I will update each week.','One of the very first side effects of this drug was spotting which I was ok with, but during the very first two months I experiences horrible cramping, way worse than the cramping of my usual period, I literally felt like my uterus was going to explode...it hurt that bad. Along with that also came the side effects of a burning vagina - very uncomfortable and worse it lasted a while, to the point where I didn&039;t want to have sex. Also for 2 weeks I was very depressed. This drug caused me to be extra sensitive to everything. Along with that on the 4th month of taking this I started to get hives all over my forehead. They were terribly itchy and nothing made them go away, even after I stopped taking it, it took months for it to go away :(','Started trulicity about 8 months ago at .75mg...in the beginning very queasy &amp; complete loss of appetite which was a great thing. Also belching &amp; heartburn/sour stomach. I noticed after about 3 months the effects wore off so my doctor put me on 1.5mg 1x per week plus the .75mg 1x per week. None of the side effects returned...my appetite is back, no queasiness, weight loss stopped as well as no more sour stomach or belching. Wonder if anyone else has experienced the effects of the medicine wearing off as well. Not sure why I am still on it at this point Also taking 1000mg Metformin 2x daily &amp; invokanna.','Whenever I am in pain, this is my go to medication. I have a back, shoulder, neck, and foot injury and by rights should be on this medicine for chronic pain. For right now I only take it very rarely so that it works when needed, to avoid a tolerance. Because I am not working I am able to deal with the pain, however when I go back to work, I will most likely have to go on this medication or a similar one full time. The only thing I do not like is the fact that many of these narcotic pain medications contain tylenol, asperin, or ibuprofin which makes your kidneys, liver and other organs go through unnecessary stresses. I prefer it to be just oxycodone and if I need the synergy of tylenol I can add it on my own.','*Sebaceous Hyperplasia*, The one change I am most thrilled about is it got rid of all of my sebaceous hyperplasia (enlarged oil glands) bumps within the first week I started getting these hard bumps about 5 years ago and 26 days ago, I had about 40 of them around my hairline and some on my chin, forehead, and cheek and my chest was starting to get super bumpy, today (day 26 on Accutane) I don&039;t have a single bump. *Acne* As far as my acne, I am definitely having a flare up and it feels like all of my blackheads are being pushed out and so my skin feels very bumpy, but as of about 5 days ago I don&039;t have to blot anymore and I can go 3 days without washing my hair.','My boyfriend and I had sex on 2/6 around 5pm and the condom broke. I was scared that he didn&039;t pull out fully and accidentally finished inside me. The last time I got my period was on 1/22. I wanted to purchase Plan B but I didn&039;t get the pill until the next day around 12 pm. 5 days after taking the pill I was bleeding for about 4 days (super light). I was waiting and waiting for my period to come but nothing was happening. I was getting impatient and really nervous that I was actually pregnant so I went and bought a pregnancy test and it came out negative. I finally got my period today on 2/13 around 5 pm, I could not be happier. The pill works ladies so relax.','I have been diabetic since 1989 and have gotten worse over the years.  My A1C has been climbing steadily.  I take Metformin 2500 mg per day.  In March my Dr started me on Januvia also and I can&039;t believe the difference.  My A1C went from 9.4 to 7.0 in 4 months.  I am also surprised I haven&039;t had any side effects because it seems many meds bother me.  My problem now is my new health insurance won&039;t cover Januvia as of Jan 2016.  Yuck.','I&039;ve had asthma ever since I quit smoking.  I&039;ve quit twice and each time after 3 years, the asthma kicks in - bad  I&039;ve tried everything and am now on Dulera, which helped tremendously.  My insurance wouldn&039;t cover it; $375 for one inhaler.  Found PAN online and they are taking care of the cost.  If not for PAN, I would not be able to take Dulera.  However, after several months on this med, my teeth starting rotting - very quickly.  My dentist said he only sees this kind of deterioration in chemo patients and someone who hasn&039;t brushed in 20 years.  I&039;ve had two teeth pulled already, and another is scheduled to be pulled.  Also, started with thrush a day ago and today I can barely move my tongue.  (Yes, I&039;ve been rinsing.)','Everyone reacts to drugs in different ways however I will never again take bactrim. I started feeling tired and got a bad headache the second day after taking it. That same night was even worse... I felt nauseous, my head hurt even worse, and all I could do was cry. I felt like I wasn&039;t even in my own body. The medicine definitely messed with my head. It was the worst feeling ever. Now I know to never take bactrim or any other sulfur drugs','Life is livable again. I have had no side effects. I stay very aware of the possibility for abuse so am very careful. I count my pills throughout the month and have to give a urine sample every couple months at the pain clinic. I have been on the same dose..60 mg every 12 hours for approx. 5 years. I cannot go back to life before I was placed on this medicine. There has been and always will be people who will abuse pain medicines and I can understand why doctors are so afraid to prescribe them but someone has to stand up and treat people like myself so we can get out of bed and face the day.','I have been on this pill for a month and a half after my pharmacy gave it to me, I called to say you gave me the wrong pill (Junel Fe 24 is what I was on) and they said the manufacturer changed but this is the SAME birth control. It&039;s manufactured in India. In a month and a half, I have gained 7-8 pounds. I am very athletic, I eat a plant based diet, I work out, I sit as a job but that hasn&039;t made me gain weight like this. I amannoyed. I worked for 9 months to lose 30 pounds, now I am gaining weight for no reason, crying all the time for no reason, self doubting myself and my poor boyfriends love for me, AND BREAKING OUT which is why I got on birth control in the first place.','After having a heart attack I became very depressed.  I have been on Lexapro, Zoloft, Xanax, Ativan, Wellbutrin, and Buspar.  None worked and I attempted suicide.  I have Major depession and anxiety disorder, so take my comments in stride.  The right drug for you is out there along with intensive therapy.  I was switched to Effexor XR while in &quot;the funny farm.&quot;  After the typical waiting period for it to kick in, I can tell you I am a new man, looking at life like I used to.  It has saved my life and my family.  It hasn&039;t done much for anxiety, so for the first few months after my severe &quot;episode&quot; I was on Seroquel. I have now been switched to clonazepam for that issue.  Please consult a proper medical person.','Cymbalta does indeed work. Most who have given it a fair shake know the results and it is seen by reading the comments here. Most people who quit using Cymbalta never gave it a &quot;real&quot; chance of working properly. For most people, Cymbalta starts working quickly, but some may take 2-3 weeks or more to get the full effect.  ','I have been on doxycycline hyclate (100 my once a day) for 3 months now and it has worked wonders for me. At first I was taking it on an empty stomach like it was recommended, but found that it gave me extreme nausea and stomach pains. I then started taking it 2 hours after my meals and my stomach pains stopped. Its taken a while for my body to get used to the medication, but after about a month my acne started to go away. At the 2 month mark all of my acne was gone. It takes time but it has worked wonders for me.','I was on this for 5 weeks broke out in hives- now off of it and on Prednisone. I also take Lamictal so she took me off that too as she didn&039;t know which med was causing the issue. If you start itching get to your DR right away','So I have been on the BuTrans patch 10microgram/hour for the last 5 months I took anti sickness tablets so I had no sick feeling or any side effects at all.  It has been a godsend this patch I&039;m in no pain  I noticed in 4 days...I&039;m from Ireland I fell and fractured my back in 5 places I was in severe pain with my back and spasms which left me sleeping in a chair for 3 months. Since I came on the patch I&039;m back in my bed so this patch is the best ever in my opinion anyways hope this helps some one I&039;m a 25 year old girl from Ireland ','Let me start by saying I am 59 years old. Until now, I have not had a problem losing when I needed to.  I am not big on diet pills so I was a little hesitant at first.  The 2 week free trial helped me decide to give it a try. The first 2 weeks I lost 6 pounds.  I lost a total of 45 pounds on this medicine and kept it off for a year  I have recommended it and so far have had several friends go on it an loose weight with equal success.  You have to cut back on food intake and exercise.  I highly recommend it','After getting it and reading on the Internet about it I was worried about taking it, but you know, Internet tends to dramatize thing. Been taking it for years now and still works amazingly, knocks me out in 20 minutes reliably, and keeps me down a good 8 hours. I&039;ve never felt hangover effects from it whatsoever. In fact its quite the opposite; because when you&039;re not used to getting a decent night of rest, when you do, you&039;re damn right you&039;ll feel great. Everyone is different and it&039;s compatability with you simply has to be tested. All the Internet horror stories on this drug are inapplicable for my case. My only problem is, doctors are very stingy with dealing adequate amounts due to dependancies. Yes I&039;m addicted, I&039;m addicted to sleep.','I started 5/14/15 and after schpeel from my doc about 15\% experience headaches I prepared myself for a huge headache by noon.  I took at 8am, no headache by noon or after..I was really tired and body aches but could be from the cold I had as well.  Able to function all day though.  My weight Thursday was 226.7 as of Saturday am my weight is 224.5.  I am learning my hunger is mental and not physical. My mental or craving are still present but not actually feeling hungry so I can stop at a few bites because nothing really tastes as good as it does in my &quot;hungry mind&quot;.  So I&039;m definitely becoming aware of my triggers.  Can&039;t wait to see my results after 1mo.','Only day one, but I think it&039;s starting to work. But I had to write in - this medicine STINGS like crazy on any type of open sore. Takes an hour or so to calm down. It works great.','I was diagnosed a month ago with rheumatoid arthritis. My doctor started me on Plaquenil 2 weeks ago. 300 mg 2x a day. I had to stop taking it after a week because it upset my stomach causing vomiting, nausea, and extreme diarrhea. My doctor tried lowering my dose to 150 mg 1x a day to no avail. I&039;m hoping that she can put me on something that will work better as I have been in extreme pain for over a year. I am 30 years old.','6 Years I&039;ve been on this pill. It&039;s a great pill if you hate having a period every month. But being 22 is a lot different than being 16, and my body just isn&039;t liking the pill anymore.  Main Con&039;s - Heavy bleeding, ZERO sex drive.  Con&039;s of taking the pill in the 1st to 3 years - Painful sex due to vaginal dryness, slight nausea if took in the morning Con&039;s at the end &amp; why I&039;m stopping (4-6 years) - Hair loss (just more hairs come out when I would brush it)  More pee breaks, breakthrough bleeding, cramps &amp; spotting when climaxing, &amp; spotting during vigorous workouts.  Pro&039;s - Never got pregnant, stable mood, no breakouts, hair thinner on arms&amp;legs I never had spotting in between packs( until Now) or gained any weight, &amp; I&039;m pretty sedentary.','Excellent cleared all symtoms in 24hours','Have only been using now for 1 full day, and have not notice much, I no longer have pain in my eye, not as watery but still red at the bottom of my bottom lid.  Will continue to use and see what happens','I had my first episode when I was 12 months. The side effects I get are decrease in appetite, forget minor things, &amp; headaches. They couldn&039;t tell what was wrong with me at that time. At the age of 12 years old I had my 2nd episode in my sleep. I found myself crawling to my parents room because I couldn&039;t walk or talk correctly. When I went to the hospital they diagnosed me with epilepsy. What causes my seizures is an enlarge blood vessel on the right side of my brain. I started off with 750mg of Levetiracetam. I only had episodes when I missed 1-3 days of my medicine. Now I will be 19 years old in April &amp; I am now taking 500mg of Levetiracetam. They&039;re lowering the doses as I get older.','I honestly wish I was going through childbirth because at least they give you a ton of drugs. THIS PAIN IS UNBEARABLE I wouldn&039;t wish this on my worst enemy... I want to itch so bad that I feel like a dog','Just got my IUD placed today I was honestly so terrified to go I had put it off for a year now. It was the quickest, least painful procedure I&039;ve had. My Dr paced a local anesthetic and I didn&039;t feel a thing.','Let me just start this by saying, you need to wait this birth control out. I had some moderate acne before taking the pill, and was needing to get back on a birth control and figured that yaz would be a good bet. Well, I have really zero side effects with yaz. Which I was so happy with. I still have a sex drive, I don&039;t get headaches, bitchiness, or stomach aches. Overall, great pill. I had read the reviews about the pill before going on it and noticed most people had an initial first break out period with it getting better until month 3, so true The first two months were hell, terrible breakouts I would say the worst in my life. But I am now in month four, and am hardly breaking out Wait it out, it will pay off','This is the 2nd time I have been on this pill, the first time was in 2007 and I lost 78 lbs. Well I just started it again on 1/5/17 and I have lost 5 lbs. I tend to lose about 5-7 lbs a week on it in the past with no workouts but this time I am going to start the gym this week. I weigh 215 and I stand 5&039;6 and my goal weight is 160...  The first 4 nights I could not sleep but now I&039;m sleeping like a baby and feeling refreshed in the morning, I take my pill as soon as I wake up   ','I have found that this medicine does clear up my eczema temporarily. However, I find that I have a lot of burning sensations around my face- specifically my eyes feel very very warm when I&039;m using it.','I am 60 and have ED. I have been taking Cialis and it has turned back the clock for me.  I take 10 mgs and 24hrs later I am ready for action. The effect lasts for 36 hrs. I can make love to my wife for 2 hrs straight and not orgasm. In the meantime my wife has had 3-4 orgasms. After resting a while we go at it again.In all sorts of positions. My wife keeps begging me to orgasm but I can hold on. Finally after a week of making love like this I decide to orgasm which is so intense and long Both of us are so happy. Cialis rocks .','Had simmilar antipsychotic effects of Seroquel, and yet had far less sedative and flattening effects on the psyche. A great alternative to other medications with similar applications.','Worked quickly (or it was in my head), lots of yawning, by week 4 very drowsy in the morning on my 90 minute drive to work so started taking it after I got to work which is better for society in general. Sometimes restless sleep. Having said that, I had a lot negative thoughts about my life that I don&039;t notice or dwell on now so I am really good with these minor side effects. I&039;m much happier, less irritable and family recognized it easily. I&039;m genuinely happy with it and thankfully no nasty side effects (thus far).','I first got Nexplanon May 2014 and my arm was pretty bruised after, as expected, but I had no pain otherwise. I had no periods (except for light spotting twice, both lasting less than 24 hours). I had no weight gain and no mood swings, but the first few weeks I felt so tired I was very apathetic and exhausted for no reason - I never adjusted my eating or sleeping habits so I had nothing other to attribute it to than the implant. So July 2015 (14 month in) I had my first full blown period. Then a week later I had another and then a week after that I started spotting. It&039;s now Sept 15 and my marathon period is still happening. I saw my gyno and I&039;ve been taking estadiol daily which is only slightly helping. Gonna give it thru the month :/','I am a 22 yr old female. Hated the significant side effects of Vyvase60mg. Hated Invuniv. Love the patch. Allows me to control the medication. I usually take it off about 7 hours after putting it on. This allows me to sleep at night. I can focus at work very well and no significant drop. I realized I cannot blow dry my hair, or go tanning with it on or I would get a big burst of medication Sometimes have a hard time sleeping if I don&039;t take it off early','I take cymbalta for depression and anxiety. I&039;ve read a few comments on here and it sounds like a few people may have or had serotonin syndrome. It has happened to me in the past when a prior doct didn&039;t pay attention to my meds. Please be safe. Cymbalta has helped me a lot. I went off for about 3 yrs and have had to go back on.','This helped suppress my cough from a cold but gave me diarrhea. Diarrhea seems to happen with all similar medicines.','This medicine helped me to stop drinking almost immediately. I started on 200mg every 2 hrs and am now on 1200mg every 6 hrs. It is a miracle pill I advise any alcoholic to try it','I was just prescribed this medicine 3 days ago for high blood pressure, running an average of 139/90. I am 38 with high blood pressure and strokes that run in the family.  Day two and three I have had a severe temporal headache and itchy throat. Called the doctor but only suggested sinus medication at this time. I am taking 5mg once a day.','I have used Halobetasol Propionate 0.05\% for over 20 yrs for moderate plaque psoriasis on a daily routine. The only draw back I have noticed is the area treated is thin skinned. Also if I run out and do not use for more than a few days, my psoriasis becomes &quot;angry&quot;. The itching becomes unbearable and the inflammation is awful as is the redness, plus it spreads and becomes bigger. There is pain where the plaques are. I have tried a lot of the OTC medicine and none help me. Just a lot of money spent.','I have had intermitant Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) since 2012 presenting with viral-like symptoms. My ID Dr. found that a local reknowned University is treating CFS with Anti-Virals and we decided to give it a shot. It took about 4 months to work but at the moment I am currently in a 7 month remission which is unprecedented(the longest remission previous was 2 months.)  I still have the fear that my symptoms may one day return but at the moment it looks like Valtrex is keeping them at bay. For CFS sufferers who test positive for HSV-1, HHV 6, EBV etc., I would recommend asking your Dr. about this medicine.','this nasal spray has been life changing for me. having suffered with allergy problems all year round for over 25 years ( constant sneezing,runny nose,itchy eyes and headaches) all of these symptoms have completely stopped. in short a miracle drug','I started taking Belviq March 28, 2016. It has been just about a week now. I would suggest that you go with the 15-day free trial before you consider purchasing this product. It hasn&039;t worked for me at all, in fact I almost feel like I&039;m taking a placebo. I haven&039;t noticed any change in my appetite other than being just as hungry or hungrier. I&039;m not really sure how it&039;s supposed to work, I just know that isn&039;t working. I purchased the 30-day supply so I&039;m going to keep taking it until I finished all of the medication, but I doubt very seriously that I&039;ll be reordering. Maybe by some miracle something will happen after 2 or 3 weeks. I&039;m very disappointed because I really want to lose weight and I don&039;t want to have surgery.','I&039;m 17 and my hands were sweaty whenever I thought about it...lately I&039;ve been thinking about it all the time cause i was worried about shaking hands and/or leaving sweaty marks after me whenever I touched something. It&039;s got really bad and I went to see a doctor. She told me to try Drysol, which I did and it worked great, but not at first...it actually made my hands sweat even more, probably cause I was stressed about if it was gonna work or not. It started to work, after applying it twice a day for a few days (doc told me to). The last time I used it was like 5 nights ago, and my palms have been so dry since that I had to use a hand cream. Yeah, unbelievable    Just dont give up on it too fast and it will work..good luck','I&039;m writing this to calm the nerves of the constant Internet searches during this uncertainty period between taking plan B and waiting for your period. I had sex a day before my ovulation day, the condom broke and we didn&039;t realize till he finished. I started freaking out since I knew that plan B worked by delaying ovulation, though my calendar said I would ovulate the next day it wasn&039;t 100\% certain that I was already ovulating or finished ovulating. I took plan B an hour after intercourse and asked the pharmacists if it would work during ovulation and the pharmacist told me that it is recommended at any time of the cycle. I experienced headache, bloating, nausea, breast tenderness/swelling and pre ovulation discharge till I got my period','I took this, started at 60 mg. Caused severe restlessness and lack of sleep. Felt like I had tachycardia going on but didn&039;t. switched down to 30 mg without doctors consent and don&039;t get restless or have the feeling in my chest as bad. It&039;s been a little over a week wish I had better idea on if it&039;s working or not.','I took the recommended dose at 9:30 am after horrible constipation cramps and bloating. Nothing but stomach gurgling occured that entire day. I had to take another dose that evening around 7 pm. Still...nothing by bedtime. I didn&039;t get relief until around 9 am the next morning and from that point on I was afraid to move or leave the toilet. And it took about a full 10 hours of off and on emergency bathroom trips (those uh oh Get up and run kinds) to get it all out.','I immediately began bleeding from my rectum after  taking this medication. It was painful and I had to be rushed to the emergency room. I don&039;t recommend anyone taking this medication.','I&039;ve found this product helps to shrink the nasal passages to relieve some of the pressure, but not the headache the build up causes.  They should consider including acetometophine (sp?) for the PAIN that the built up pressure can cause.  In addition to taking the Alavert-D, I have to also take 2 Tylenol for the pain in order to get relief.  Even with taking the Alavert-D and the pressure being released, the pain does not subside unless I take something for it.','I LOVED Cymbalta, I felt wonderful, no aches and pains, no depression, I had my life back. I was paying $90 for a 3 month supply... THEN it happened, my co-pay went to $1000 for a 3 month supply I want to cry, I obviously can&039;t afford that so I got switched to Venlafaxine, I now have a constant slight headache and it makes me nauseous, my anxiety is back. Dr. switched me to Prozac yesterday, we shall see but what I would not give to have my Cymbalta back.','Love this medicine I also have RA and take the mx shot rasuvo. The 2 shots from the starter pack lasted 3 weeks. I can walk barefoot and play sports with my kids. orencia wore off after about 3 months and humeria was like taking water. No side effects thus far. One happy mom','I was prescribed Rexulti when my daily depression meds began to no longer work for me. It started working almost instantly I have been on Rexulti along with my daily meds, and I have been feeling better then ever.','I am in my third trimester and the hemorrhoids have been horrible I was in bed for a week and tried ever OTC cream plus home remedies. My OB proscribed me proctofoam and it&039;s been a life saver. The only thing that has worked.','I&039;ve been on Zoloft for 3 months now. Initially, I suffered from side effects such as shivering, loss of appetite, drowsiness, and insomnia. These symptoms lasted for about three days. I was scared at first and planned on trying another medication for anxiety. However, I called my cousin who is a nurse and she told me to try cutting the pill in half. I took my cousins advice and cut the pill in half, taking only 25mg a day which works really well for me.I&039;m 5&039;4, 130lbs. I no longer suffer from anxiety, after taking Zoloft that I realized that I was suffering from depression. Zoloft alleviates my anxiety and has greatly helped with my depression, I now feel more happy and motivated to do things right away without procrastinating. Life changer','I had my first seizure in 04/04/14 whilst driving and they found that I had epilepsy. The neurologist put me on keppra. It is by far the best drug I&039;ve had to take. Initially it was a pain as I was always angry, depressed because I lost my Driving Licence and tired all the time. All I wanted to do was sleep. However, once it took this medication after 6 months, the side effects wore off and I was getting back to my old self again. Happy and all that. I once forgot to take my tablets for 2 days. I had a seizure. Biggest mistake I&039;ve made. I always remember to take my tablets now. I&039;m fit free now. Please take your tablets. They do help.','I found that this medicine helped me more than anything else I have ever tried.','Took this medication twice a day for 10 days for infection of sinuses and adenoids. First three days my stomach hurt and headaches. Remainder of the days no side effects until the day I stopped taking it developed diarrhea and severe stomach cramping that didn&039;t go away. 5 days after stopping the med now positive for C DIFF. I even took probiotics through the entire course of the med. Getting married in a week. Thanks a lot Cefdinir. I wanted everyone to be aware of this','Been on Tramadol off and on for minor headaches and issues with Iliotibial band syndrome and arthritis. Basically since it is controlled it is a lot harder to obtain from a doctor and is also considered the new &quot;painkiller&quot; in ER&039;s or doctor&039;s office unless you have a broken bone. In all honesty it helps my leg and lets me focus at work. I&039;ve tried the norco and vicodin es,also lyrica and gabapentin but I&039;m not a fan. I dislike the nausea feeling and the grogginess. But at the same time everyone is different some people can stand this medication and some people cannot. I would recommend to those who have less major pain and do&039;nt need it all the time.','Great medicine.  I take it only in the morning at a low dosage - it&039;s a bit of an upper and helps my brain work better and faster.  Probably no good for bipolars on the high energy side.  It&039;s therapeutic, too - unlike lithium it&039;s there working all the time.  Wouldn&039;t take it at night, and something to wind down from it is helpful.  No side effects besides lunchtime headaches, a little extra clumsiness and mixing up words sometimes when I&039;m speaking or typing.','I started using this cream about 5 months ago for my moderate acne (.025) I started using it everyday after I washed my face before I went to bed. For the first 3 months or so my face became dry, red, and irritated. I used moisturizer to combat the dryness but it was irritating. Using my my old s acid face wash stung so bad. My acne also got worse during these first three months. A lot of whiteheads and bumps that never fully emerged. I pushed through thanks to these reviews and by the 4 month, things started looking up. Now my face is mostly clear and scars are beginning to fade and the irritation and dryness have improved a bit. To all you struggling, keep it up','I was given the medication by my family doctor for a muscle I pulled in my back. Even after 3 days I am still in pain. It has done nothing for me. ','4 years ago I was in a bicycle accident and broke my left shoulder. About 6 months later I started seeing an orthopedic surgeon and going to a pain clinic. I have been taking 180mg of morphine IR for 3 1/2 years with great success. I have had two shoulder replacement. The first one failed because the damage around the joint was so severe. The 2nd one gave me about 75\% of the usage back which is amazing. However, I am still in excruciating pain without pain medication. The morphine I&039;ve been taking is a godsend. I&039;m still focused and alert and able to do most of the everyday things I need to do. I also have an exceptionally helpful and loving husband who help with physical therapy and anything else I need help with. Works for me','I just started Humira the beginning of this month, I&039;ll be taking my fourth shot next week. I have to say I&039;m very impressed I&039;ve had psoriasis since I was 18 and I&039;m almost 22 now. I have it on my elbows, legs, feet and scalp. After the first 2 starter doses, my elbows are completely cleared. The spots on my legs and feet are in the process of fading I&039;m so anxious to see the improvement after a few months The only side effects I&039;ve noticed is that I&039;m much more tired and my muscles are achy .. But I much rather deal with that any day of my psoriasis. I strongly suggest trying this medicine if you are struggling with psoriasis. I was honestly out of options, tried everything else and nothing ever worked. TRY IT.','Drug seems to work well. I had the flushing bouts in the first month lasted all of 10 minutes This is the only drug I have been on since being diagnose in 11/14.','Amazing.  Yes, of course there were side effects.  I felt tired and a bit nauseous about an hour after taking the pill.  I countered this by taking the &quot;evening&quot; pill at night before bed and then I would be fine.  I had a few vivid dreams, but nothing crazy.  This medicine works...if you really want to quit smoking.  It isn&039;t magic and you do have to put some effort in.  Of course you will be cranky and a bit more anxious than normal, your brain has no idea how to deal with stress without smoking.  None of these are reasons to not try it.  I was a pack a day smoker for 15 years and I have not smoked for 10 weeks and have zero desire to do so.  It&039;s truly a miracle medicine.','I have been on Belviq for about a week.  I must say, I got sick right away and felt awful for about 4-5 days.  It was a combination of getting a cold/cough and taking the Belviq I believe.  The side affects have been gone for two days and I feel great  Food doesn&039;t even look that good and when I do eat something it is very easy to eat half or a third of what I normally would.  Like others have said- willpower in a bottle  I will update in a few months','My son has been on this patch for a year.  We started at 10mg, and are moving to 15 mg now.  It has (by far) been the best ADHD medicine we&039;ve tried. We have had pretty minimal skin irritation issues overall.  Sometimes the backing of the patch is hard to peel, but 15 seconds in the freezer solves that problem.  By far our favorite ADHD medicine.','Midrin, Epidrin, isometheptene-dichloralphenazone-acetaminophen, Isometh/Dich/Apap 65-100-325, whatever variation of name it is dispensed as, it is the best migraine treatment for me. It must be administered early into the headache or it is much less effective. That&039;s the only downside, and one I&039;ve managed to deal with successfully over many years now.  I take 2 capsules at onset and one more tablet each hour after as needed (usually total of three capsules is enough) Only side affect is it makes me sleepy. I went through two years trying out various Rx&039;s, shots, treatments with my doctor, but once we tried Midrin I got my life back.The difficulty getting it lately has me jumping through hoops and the price skyrocketed, but it&039;s worth it.','I have been on escitalopram for 3 months or so. I take it for mild panic attacks and it seems to have knocked them out for the most part. A side benefit is that my OCD Hs pretty much been eliminated. I didn&039;t really realize that I had OCD but I guess I have always had it. Nothing severe, I couldn&039;t have remotes, cell phones or similar items pointing at me and at work I used to make sure I did everything in a certain order while having all my tools lined up in specific ways. I think now I do it out of habit but I&039;m not scrambling to put something in order if I notice that it isn&039;t.  I&039;m not sure what my dosage is but I haven&039;t experienced any negative side effects that I can think of. Hope you all have the same benefits that I do.','No medication has gotten rid of all of my symptoms but Zyprexa Zydis is one of the best I&039;ve tried (and I have tried them all literally). I noticed the munchies on regular Zyprexa tabs but none on Zyprexa Zydis....I have actually lost weight. I gave it a rating of 8 because I still have symptoms of schizoaffective disorder but high enough rating to give it kudos compared to other drugs.','I used to have a lot of problems with my bi-polar. I was self medicating with marijuana. I started taking Zoloft and things worked well, although once I had a major manic episode and lost all my money. Ouch','This is THE best anti-acne solution there is. Reading most of the other reviews, I can see people are not using it correctly. A dermatologist in Scotland put me on to this (Duac 12mg/g 50mg/g gel) and explained it is TO BE USED SPARINGLY. i.e. do not rub it all over your face or it will not only burn and dry your skin (which in turn will cause your sebacious glands to activate to moisturise your skin which can lead to get more acne infection) but also make your system more resistant to the antibiotic.  IMPORTANT: Apply to each pimple individual and slightly around the area, not all over your face or back  I have since been given another tube of Duac in Romania that is weaker (10mg/g 30mg/g) &amp; found this still works, might be better for some','I have never felt a pain like I did upon the Skyla insertion. It was a 3-step process, and the second step was the most painful. They say it is different for everyone, apparently my pain threshold is much lower than other women. This sharp pain and cramping cause immediate tears and a small yelp. Immediately after, I became very pale and lightheaded and had to use the restroom. I could hardly sit up in the bathroom because I was so lightheaded and nausea caused me to vomit. I was so weak and honestly wanted to just lie on the floor because I began to sweat. After about 30 minutes, I was able to stand up and drive home. The cramps and nausea remained very severe until the next morning. Ibuprofen and heating pads helped me sleep that night.','I had this inserted today.  Due to extremely heavy bleeding during my periods I chose to get an IUD.  The previous reviews freaked me out  The insertion hurt for about 10 seconds and then I just felt cramps a bit heavier than my period.  It was not as bad as some of these reviews stated (maybe a 6/10).  I was told to expect moderate cramping for about 3 days as my body adjusts and light bleeding for 3-6 months.  Hoping this will be worth it','When I say I have NEVER, EVER taken/applied any medication to my cold sores before that is as effective as Valtrex, I MEAN IT. I have been dealing with this virus forever and I have tried everything. My doctor gave me a prescription to have on hand and 3 weeks ago, as I was afraid to ask for it at the pharmacy. 2 days ago though, when I woke up with that infamous tingle I ran and filled it up. I messed up the dosage but once I caught up, it REALLY began to disappear. By mid 2nd day, it was practically flat and I typically swell badly. Its day 3 and I&039;m back to normal. Thank God for Valtrex Try it.','I have tried heat pads, freeze pads, gels tablets and I am really pleased I saw these advertised on the TV I tried them and I had no expectations at all.  I was very surprised that they worked on my neck pain my hip pain back pain and have no complaints worth giving a go may not be suitable for everyone but worked for me.','As I lay here weighing the benefits of clawing the inside of my own vagina vs. continuing to let the medicine take effect, I wish more than anything i never inserted this devil cream inside my body in the first place. This is night one for me, and I&039;m just going to tough out the YI and not use it again. EVER. I can&039;t do another night of this. The mild itching I had before is NOTHING compared to the itching I have now. If there were sandpaper near me, I would use it. Repeatedly. Inside and out. I can feel my heart beating in my vagina. That&039;s the pain I&039;m feeling.','Dont know...','These took almost twenty four hours to work. I decided to take two at 10.30am rather than before bed as I had read drinking lots and eating helps to reduce the stomach cramps. After reading other horror stories of nausea, projectile vomiting and cramps worse than giving birth I braced myself. No need really at all. Yes I felt a little sick and my stomach became bloated throughout the day. Went to bed terrified I was going to wake up in crippling agony. Nothing. Woke up the following morning and at 7am my stomach felt like washing machine. What followed was diarrhoea on and off all morning but not the I can&039;t cope shoot me now kind. It didn&039;t hurt and I have not had one cramp, sweat or feeling of faintness.','After 7 days of taking Doxycycline my Chlamydia infection went away. I had awful side effects from Doxycycline though, and I am still having them 3 days after my final dose.','Just an FYI to all on this medication. Diarrhea is the way you body gets rid of toxins. That is how you know your antibiotic os working.. The side effects of nausea and heartburn can be mangable. But diarrhea is actually a good sign that the end is near and you will be feeling better. If it gets to be too much and you are dehydrated then you should think about stopping the medication.  I would recommend this medication to help with all indicated infections.','Works well for me with regular use.','I am a 40yr old female.  I have had acne since I was 13.  I noticed bumps all over my forehead for years along with a large cystic pimple a couple times a year.  6 weeks ago my dermatologist prescribed Aczone along with 2 antibiotics(1 oral 1 topical--Solodyn and Ziana).  This has been the perfect trifecta of treatment  My forehead has not been this clear since I was a a kid and my skin is significantly less greasy.  Highly recommend','I&039;d been on the Nor-QD pill for many years without problem.  This year my insurance changed and the pharmacy issued Sharobel in its place.  I thought it&039;d be fine since it has the the exact same amount of NORETHINDRONE.  Wow, was I wrong  Luckily I only got a three month supply because I am quitting this pill.  In two and half months on this pill, I&039;ve had a period or bleeding every 5-7 days.  It&039;s not just bleeding, I get the whole deal; cramps, lower back pain, hunger cravings, crankiness, and bloating.  My skin has broken out, I&039;ve been super irritable/moody, and I don&039;t understand how the side effects can be so extreme for me when I previously was on Nor-Qd for so long and experienced none of these things.','It stopped my cough, but I had severe diarrhea.  I figured it out after it happened to me twice.','I started taking BC pills when I was 15 yrs old. Began using Sprintec when I was maybe 16 or 17. Either way I&039;m 22 now and am happy with my body and its&039; cycle. I get my period usually on time every 4 weeks (28 days). I do cramp, but lighter than off OC. I have never been pregnant to my knowledge, and I wouldn&039;t say I&039;m remotely good with taking it on time or every day. Sprintec is very reliable in my opinion, I would recommend it to someone interested or looking at BC.','I&039;m allergic to morphine, Demerol, and several other pain medications. I took Toradol for severe neck and shoulder pain. It worked. I had a little upset stomach but took an antacid, and it went away. It worked better for me, because of me being allergic to other pain medications. It also worked wonders after surgery. It should not be taken for more than 5 days, and use caution if you have kidney or liver disease. Use caution if you are using a blood thinner. It also did not make we drowsy, fast heart rate, or dizzy.','The packaging is HORRIBLE  Take a page from Vagifem and work on the delivery','It has been decent. I have definitely seen a cut back in my oil production and acne on my neck, however I have been getting breakouts on my cheeks and forehead and I never really did before. I don&039;t see much of a difference other than less oil. My acne location just pretty much relocated.','I started this birth control 4 months ago right before I left for college in August. I read reviews and I was iffy but my OB promised me everyone&039;s body is different and I should try it out. The first month was okay. I was happy as ever at college. I got horrible cramps when I got my first period on it and my period was really irregular but I figured I just needed to adjust. Come late October, November, and now December have been the worst months of my life. I&039;m crying every day, lost my boyfriend, planned on started therapy, don&039;t want to go back to school, nothing makes me happy I want to do nothing at all times. everybody&039;s body is different but this depression isn&039;t even worth risking. Do not take.','I have had some side effects. Really heavy periods and about two days after I take it out, I have extreme hot flashes that make me extremely warm. I was out on a very cold day when this last happened, my head was just about soaked with sweat.','I&039;m so glad I finally read reviews about this pill, and people are not lying when they say it&039;s the worst. I recently found out that I have vertigo, but I was dealing with what I thought were vertigo symptoms for much longer than my doctor said they would last. The symptoms of this pill and vertigo are extremely similar. I am constantly light headed. Almost everyday. Sometimes to the point where I can&039;t even drive. It makes me nauseous. I can&039;t focus at work. And if you think people who said if gives them mood swings were being dramatic, they&039;re not. I have anxiety attacks on a regular basis. I&039;ve most definitely gained weight and have seen my acne get worse. DON&039;T TAKE THIS PILL','My Pulmonary Function Tests were the best they have been in 12 years since I switched from Advair Diskus to Alvesco.  I feel SO much better.','All my life, a typical night would start with 1 to 2 hours laying in bed before falling asleep, and then waking several times with trouble getting back to sleep.  My bedroom has light blocking curtains plus a white noise machine, but I still had trouble getting more than five hours of sleep.  My Doctor has prescribed Ambien CR, Rozerem, Sonata, Restoril and Trazadone.  I have tried Benadryl and Melatonin/Valerian pills but nothing worked well or long term until I tried Quetiapine.  I take 50mg 30 minutes before bedtime and I sleep a good 6 to 8 hours daily  I have more vivid dreams but no nightmares, and 3 years with no loss of effectiveness and no weight gain  A good dose of morning caffeine and I have no lingering grogginess either','The Nilstat cleared up the white spots in my mouth within 2 days and my throat was less sore so that I could start eating solid food for the first time since radiation treatment.(10 weeks) On the third bottle but have not fully cleared all the thrush from my throat. I have had Chemo. radiation and heaps of antibiotics so I am a hard case for it..','Caused me to do things and not remember afterwards...I would be cautious while first taking this medication.','I have never been so upset/embarrassed with outbursts of anger. The day before I was screaming at my daughter at a water park as well as my poor son in the airport.   I can&039;t believe my aggressive behavior. I&039;m getting off of this.','Well, I am using 400mg per day together with Rexetin (Paroxetine) and Fluonxol, sometimes Xanax. I used to have much more medicine, because I have manic depression with tendency to self harm and sleep disorder. What I like about this medicine is that I can have kind of 3D dreams and I can sleep normally, but what I dislike is that I have low libido and that&039;s why my boyfriend thinks that something is wrong with him (even when I say that it is just a side effect of medicines I have to take). It just seems for me like &quot;must to do&quot; action without any passion. And it is strange because I was very different before with great sex drive.','I had unprotected sex the day before I started ovulating, and took the morning after pill 7 hours after the sex. An hour after taking the pill I had cramps, bleeding, and felt really tired. The next week I had breast tenderness and sometimes what felt like cramps. My advice is to take it ASAP, to not panic and don&039;t read plan b horror stories. Go into planned parenthood and talk to someone if you need a peace of mind or you can chat with someone online, I did and it helped me a lot. I got my period two days early and it was slightly heavier than normal. Try to relax and let the pill do what it does, and take it day by day. It&039;s going to okay, whatever happens it&039;s going to be okay.','Diarrhea a side effect.','I have sleep apnea but can&039;t stand a mask on me, and without drugs I wake up constantly by stopping  to breath. I take 75 mg of diph. an hour before I want to go to sleep, have a couple puffs of indica (night time pot,) ( it&039;s legal here) and it works like a charm, I stay asleep for 5 or 6 hrs which is a long time for me, little groggy when I wake up but it goes away after a couple puffs of sativa (day time pot)  I&039;ve been a toker for 49 yrs, it&039;s good for a lot of uses. I am 66  My doctor says he agrees that pot is easier on the body and mind than prescription drugs for anxiety, insomnia, depression, pain,and loss of appetite. They make edibles, gum, etc for those that hate smoke.','I&039;ve been taking Neupogen for low WBC prior to chemo. After getting several mosquito bites that didn&039;t heal, hemorrhoids, that wouldn&039;t go away and four days of acid diarrhea each cycle, my oncologist decided to try neulasta. My hemorrhoids are less painful and the acid diarrhea  I had has seem to have gone away. I have experienced daily aches in my large bones...thighs, hips, sternum and lower spine. Tylenol helps. I won&039;t know my counts till next week. ','At first, I really liked Nuvaring. It&039;s super easy to use and it&039;s nice to be able to forget about it for 3 weeks. I could feel it every now and then but it wasn&039;t uncomfortable, just there. After one month, I ended up with the worst acne on my back and chest that I have ever had in my life. The acne was so bad, I almost thought it was a reaction. I took Nuvaring out and within a week, my skin was clear again. I didn&039;t have any other side effects besides the acne, but acne isn&039;t something I can deal with. I&039;m switching back to pills.','Took this for the first time today for a migraine and it made me sooo sick to my stomach. Severe nausea and crampy stomach pain. Will not take this again.','After suffering years of migraines, and using IMIGRAN which did not work for me, finally decided to use the nasal spray for migraines. Really works well when it wants to, but sometimes if the migraine is really bad it won&039;t do anything. I get bad side effects such as a swollen tounge and really sore and sensitive mouth, but would rather that than a migraine, so is good overall.','I started this pill a couple months before turning 18, just turned 20, so about 2 years or so. I did notice the weight gain but I quit smoking at the same time so I don&039;t really know what caused it. My periods don&039;t exist anymore.  My doctor told me I can skip my placebos and never bleed. I still spot at random times of the year. Usually twice a year and it&039;s very light to where I don&039;t have to wear anything. I have noticed my mood swings getting pretty bad at certain times but overall the pill works great for me  I haven&039;t had any issues yet.','I&039;ve only been taking it for 4 days...I&039;ve had no side effects except I&039;m always thirsty, but I see that as a positive because it forces me to drink water all day long.   I do get a little hungry at meal times, but I get full so fast - after eating a very small amount of food.  I make a green smoothie for breakfast and I am totally fine until lunch.  Yesterday I had a yogurt and some honeydew melon.  I work out most days at 5pm, so I ate a snack of a cheese stick and a couple pieces of turkey before, and then after all I had was a couple more pieces of turkey...was not hungry.  I usually snack a lot more, and eat much bigger meals  I have not weighed myself yet, I&039;m waiting till Saturday (1 week).  I am 5&039;2 and weighed 162 last Saturday.','Love this product I&039;m 34 years old and I&039;ve had acne for as long as I can remember. This stuff really works for me. I&039;ve been using it for about two weeks now and this is the best my skin has ever been. Highly recommend','I have had a wonderful experience with mirena I have had zero side effects, Its been great I cant believe so many negative reviews but everyone is different and there is something that works for everybody My sister didnt like mirena so had her taken out for paragard which she absolutely loves I honestly cant say anything bad about any IUD I think they are awesome. Pills are old news this is a new generation for women who cant take control of are bodies and choose when we are ready for babies.','I have cramps now and get daily headaches.. I truly believe it&039;s from this patch. I will finish this month then maybe go to minastrin which is less estrogen.. I haven&039;t decided yet. I would love to just do natural family planning, side effects aren&039;t worth it.','The first two days of taking the medicine, I experienced body aches all over, headaches, thus, I took aspirin in the evening to try to alleviate the pain.  The third day and beyond, I felt/feel more energized, no headaches, no backaches, mental clarity, and just relieved.  I say you have to give the medicine time to kick in and get in your system. I am thankful.','Caused anxiety and panic attacks','This birth control seemed fine at first, but 10 days into it I started feeling not like myself--bad mood swings, feeling breathless or winded even when sitting, my blood pressure would spike for no reason, and I felt extremely sluggish.  One day I even had mild heart attack symptoms.  My body definitely did not react well to this medication.','I got the Skyla inserted three weeks before I got married (virgin until then). Putting in Skyla was fast, but easily the most painful experience of my entire life. It sounds like someone is shooting a rubber-band gun and it feels like someone has shot your uterus. The cramps were the worst cramps I have had in my entire life- I couldn&039;t focus, I was in tears- really the most painful experience ever. The cramping pain and bleeding didn&039;t stop for about two months and periods are still extremely painful. I have bad mood swings, I get depressed all the time, and my libido is definitely decreased. My husband can also feel the wires sometimes and it&039;s painful to him. I&039;m not pregnant, so it works... but I&039;m not sure it&039;s worth the side effects.','I am a 28 yr old male who was very fortunate and never had acne as a kid or throughout my college years. Around my 27th birthday I started breaking out. Initially, it was not to bad and I thought it was stress from growing up and dealing with adult issues. However, it kept getting worse. I tried all the OTC meds and that was a waste of hundreds of dollars. I went to a dermatologist and I was put on Differin and it is great. The first 6 weeks were rough and I thought about quitting it a lot. I stuck with it and now my face is clear. The main thing for new users is to know that it will not work overnight and will prob get worse before it gets better. Stay with it.','After 24 hours of taking Boniva 150 mg I started experiencing severe flu like symptoms with fever and extreme pain in my bones and joints.  ','I was prescribed this for a infection on my knee and I am in a love hate relationship with this drug. Sure it did the trick (cleared it up and some of my acne as well) by the side effects were HORRIBLE. Every single night I would have a stabbing feeling in my back and chest that would last hours causing me to lose sleep... I would only recommend this if it is ABSOLUTELY necessary','I had this birth control for 3 years now and it was processe and painless .. i barely get periods and cramps. . But i noticed iv been gaining weight and its been hard to loose .. iv been having lots of mood swing and always feeling angry and depression ... but a crazy sex drive. .','I love this I take this pill and was so scared of being on birth control due to side effects of weight gain and mood swings but I&039;ve had absolutely no symptoms at all with this pill. Definitely recommend since it has given me no negative side effects at all. As long as it stays effective I will continue to use Loestrin, so glad I found a reliable birth control','I&039;ve had the paragard IUD twice.. First time around I had it in for 5 months and had It removed due to pain after sex every time. I loved it though no hormones regular periods So I ended up getting it placed again a year later and this time around is amazing No pains after or during sex I honestly don&039;t even feel it it&039;s almost as if it&039;s none existent And my periods are heavier first 2 days and crampier again only the first 2 days. So far this has been my fav BCM of all  Really recommend','On my second year out of three. No acne problems, little weight gain (5-10 pounds)  Irregular periods but that&039;s nothing new. Best thing about it, don&039;t have to remember or think about birth control and I haven&039;t got pregnant','It&039;s a life saver for me.  Chronic sinus problem that occurs twice a year.  Slight stomach issues after initial dose.  Knocks out brain fog.  Had the best night sleep in months.  Always take with food, and you will have no issues.  Made me feel 90\% better 24 hours after initial dosage.  Use with Flonase to open passages to help get it all.  Only thing that works for my sinus problems.','This medication gave me the worst experience of my life. It made me sleepy, yes. But at the same time, It sped up my mental discomfort, and it made my muscles jump. Similar to restless leg syndrome, but throughout my entire body. It was so bad they had to reverse it with Benadryl to alleviate the symptoms, And finally they gave me a mixture of Valium and Demerol to put me in a twilight state until it passed. If you have ANY medication allergies, even mild. I would strongly advise against this medication.  ','My arm was bruised after getting the implant for about a week, my period came whenever it wanted and stayed for up to 14 days at a time. After about 6 months my period had completely gone away. I had horrible hormonal changes and mood changes, I gained almost 50 pounds very quickly after getting the implant inserted.  This birth control is UP TO 3 years, after two and a half years I got pregnant. I knew it had worn off because I lost weight and felt more like myself. After finding out I was pregnant I made an appointment to get the implant removed so I could have a normal pregnancy. But I ended up having a miscarriage from the implant before I could get it removed. A big weight was lifted off my shoulders after getting it removed','I was constipated for 6 days. I tried 1/2 citrate magnesia which only made me move once with tiny balls..nothing else.i tried prunes, oatmeal, prunes blended in oatmeal, fig newtons, bran muffin, drinking 4 to 5 glasses of water 10 mins apart, walking and nothing..I was getting impacted.. I was considering taking an enema at this point but tried MoM instead. I took two full doses which equal eight tbsp.. This was suggested to me by a nurse who knows of my previous situation in which one full dose does not work for upon impaction. I drank two full glasses of water and followed with a probiotic after reading a doctor tell someone to follow MoM with a probiotic on healthtrap. it took about 6 hours and a few glasses of water and I can sleep now','Prescribed by rheumatologist for fibromyalgia (30 mg/day); have been on for just over two weeks, take it at night. Cymbalta has helped lessen my pain and has dramatically improved my mood- happier and much more relaxed. Two side effects so far: constipation and trouble sleeping. Hardly slept at all the first night or two, still only sleeping about 5 hours- waking up very early. I like the positive effects enough to weather the cons- at least for now.','I was on Zoloft years 9 years ago for social anxiety and it worked great for me. I decided to get off it but slowly all my symptoms came back. Also got very depressed. Got back in Zoloft 7 months ago and I feel great again. I did have to get a night guard from my dentist. I chipped two from teeth and cracked a molar from grinding my teeth. 200mg daily.','I&039;ve taking topamax for three years.  It helped but I started getting eye pain behind my left eye.  My eye would throb like a bird was pecking at it. I went to several doctors about it and U of L dr. figured it out...it was topamax causing the problem.  I&039;m  off of the meds.and having very little pain behind my eye.','My weight loss experience with phentermine was successful.  Early on, my doctor would refill with the agreement I would stop by every three - four weeks for a blood pressure check.  Since my blood pressure was never an issue, and everything else was good, I continued  on with the daily time-release capsule, 15 mg.  Took a few days to get used to, but after that all was good.  In six months I lost 15 pounds and am grateful it was slow and steady.  I&039;m 5&039;5&039;, weigh 137 pounds, and I feel good.  I exercise, eat lots of vegetables, try to keep carbs to a minimum and I&039;m mindful of portion sizes.  Phentermine worked for me.  I highly recommend','I have been on this for a week now with no side affects. I watch what I eat and stay away from carbs and sugars. I will be getting married in June and have been trying to loose weight since last summer by following the SOS diet very strictly and going to the gym 4 times a week and not much change. So far I am down 3 lbs. in week one. I&039;m hopeful for the first time in a long time','I got the Implant in March 2015 right after I decided to stop using the shot as my birth control method.  for the first 8 months, I LOVED it. No side effects that bothered me, I did not get any periods (which was what I was used to from the shot). And then for some reason in December 2015, I got a period that lasted for 42 days. YES 42 DAYS straight Some days were heavy spotting, or light bleeding and the rest of the days were HEAVY &amp; PAINFUL. I also have been breaking out NONSTOP since Christmas, my acne has never been this AWFUL. I am ready to take this implant out of my arm and go back on the shot. :( Sad because I was hoping to stay on this for 3 years. Not worth all the breakouts and never ending periods.','I&039;m taking this for morning sickness, I feel like it has given me my life back. I lost over 6 lbs in 5 days due to nausea and vomiting, and was too sick to do anything for my toddler, myself, or my home. I can tell when it&039;s starting to wear off (at about 6.5-7 hr.) because the nausea comes right back. I&039;ll take being backed up and a little drowsy as a side effect... it allows me to eat and keep things down and be present in my family&039;s life. Never thought I&039;d be so happy to take a medication, but I&039;m SO thankful for Zofran.','Plan B one step is a LIFESAVER. My boyfriend and I had un protective sex. So within 4 hours after the incident, I took the pill. I was paranoid as hell, not sure whether this pill would work or not ( my first time taking it and I am also young). I experienced mild cramping , head aches and nausea for five days. But my period came on time  The key is to stay calm and let the pill do its job.','This pill made me extremely emotional and anxious.','I developed a severe case of psoriasis soon after my 18th birthday, with 90\% of my body covered. For years I tried everything under the sun including steroids, PUVA, all topicals, Embrel, Humira, and methotrexate. The only thing that ever helped was the metho and if I tried to go off of it, I would be unable to leave the house for months on end, living in excruciating pain. I had been on metho for over 30 years, resigned to a life of weekly nausea and chronic lethargy, when my new doctor suggested Stelara. I tried it, positive that it would fail like everything else I had tried. And that was when life began for me again. I have now been on it for 1.5 years and for the most part completely clear. It has been a miracle for me','Solodyn is great. It starts working fast and I haven&039;t had any side effects.','Jardiance gave me back pain because I was dehydrated so I decided to drink one glass of coconut water everyday to relieve the pain and it works','I have been on this anxiolytic longer than any other, &amp; I feel that it works the best at controlling my panic attacks.','Pros: Lighter periods, some cramping but much less, no pregnancy scares. Little to no nausea after the first week. No migraines.  Cons: Horrible moodiness, depression, anxiety, feeling insecure. Weight gain (though less than other users). Painful intercourse.    After a year of being on this pill, I went off for 3 months due to insurance coverage issues. While I was off, I noticed an immediate improvement in mood and energy. After going back on, the depression/mood swings started back up again, and I noticed an extreme drop in libido. Though my experience was not as horribly negative as some others, I will be looking for another birth control.','I had surgery for scoliosis with spinal fusion 27 years ago.  Since then, my neck and lower back (without fusion) have been collapsing, curving, and I have been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease.  The pain began to extend to my hips and shoulders and it became impossible to function.  I had difficulty getting up and moving around, and more and more difficulty doing basic daily chores.  (I am a 51 y/o woman with 5 children - no wonder, right? ha ha).  Anyway, my doctor prescribed Ultram ER 100mg for me about 5 years ago and it has given me relief for the most part - until the last year.  I think I need to increase the dosage as I know my back is worse and the pain is getting worse, however, Ultram has been a life saver.','This medication has been a life saver.  I am a 23 year old female and was diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome 10 years ago.  It wasn&039;t until 2 years ago that my primary care doctor suggested this medication after finding success with another patient.  Only 10 mg a day at bedtime and I am IBS symptom free. I used to have 5  bowel motions a day and now I am very regular.  My life is so different now that I am on this medication.  When I started the medication I had extreme dry mouth that went away after a couple of months and now I sometimes become constipated (which is something I&039;ve never had in my life).','Side effects are a bit annoying sometimes, but it&039;s working for me so I&039;ll put up with it. A side note- I&039;m taking this in addition to Wellbutrin and Cymbalta. All for my RSD... I have only had intermittent pain and it was extremely mild in comparison to before this combination.','My boyfriend and I had unprotected sex on the day of my ovulation and although I took Plan B about 18 hours later I was still super paranoid for the next week and a half or so until I took a pregnancy test that calmed my nerves. I thought that I was going to be in that 10\% that still gets pregnant due to the time in my cycle that I had sex, however the pill worked perfectly with no side effects whatsoever and two weeks later I got my period. It was reading reviews online of Plan B and other situations like mine that calmed my nerves, so to anyone out there just know that this stuff really works and to not worry unnecessarily.','I wish the taste of the sucralose was not so obvious.  Couldn&039;t wait to drink it and get to the water chaser.  I started in the bathroom 1 1/2 hrs later for 4 hours..no problems sleeping at 11 pm till 6am. Was extremely cold and had chills..tripled my blankets and was still shivering.  Taking my 2nd dose now at 6:30am.  I had to pay $70 for this prep.','My throat is still really sore, I still feel really sick and tired, and the day after all my dose had finished I had severe burning and itching in my vagina and my sinuses still feel inflamed.','I started taking Synthroid 200mrgs From 2002- Oct 2012.

When I take it I mainly feel relaxed and sometimes excited. I&039;ve never been on any stimulant or ADD medication before. My main concern is losing weight on this medicine. I&039;m about 5&039;9&quot; and weigh about 135lbs. I eat a lot and I&039;m still fairly skinny. I&039;ve always worried about my weight and the last thing I want is to get skinnier. ','Started Vyvanse (30mg) about 3 years ago, and still on it to this day I am extremely more concentrated, and have more motivation throughout the entire day. This medication saved my life, and I have not looked back every since Plus you loose weight, so that&039;s a plus (:','I have been on birth control for over 16 years now.  I started with pills at 18 then Depo shot for 5 years, and now back to pills.  I was on Seasonique and was okay. I switched Gyno and to help with copay she recommended Jolessa.  I tried it and have been on it for almost 6 months now.  I have been PMS&039;ing since I started.  Breasts are constantly sore, severe mood swings, headaches and not to mention 10 pounds weight gain.  I have always exercised and eat right.  I am definitely switching','That was so strange. I gave up smoking after 10 years with the help of Effexor.','I still have flare ups during the day but there are times where my skin is completely free from any redness, especially about an hour after it&039;s applied.  It losses its effectiveness after about 6 hrs for me. After the tube is open I&039;ve tried to stretch it out past 30 days but it&039;s effective is not as good when the tube is first opened I&039;ve found. I remember it taking a few weeks when I first started using it along with a topical cream at night for my skin to start to change.  My script ran out and I went without it for a week and I hated not having it. My skin burned and hurt again when I stopped using it for that time.  Although it doesn&039;t completely eliminate systems it sure does help and I will not go a day without it.','I have been on the patch for a month and I absolutely love it. It&039;s my first form of birth control and personally I gag taking pills. Within the first month of using the patch I lost 3 pounds. My sex drive is high and my breast got a little larger. Slightly. I had cramps during my week of the patch but I didn&039;t mind. I rather have cramps than having my period for an entire month. I recommend the patch for anyone who wants a form of birth control who don&039;t want to gain weight.','I have spinal stenosis in 2 levels of my lumbar spine and 3 bulging/protruding discs. I could hardly sit or walk for months. I was hoping for surgery just to ease the pain. I couldn&039;t drive for longer than 15 minutes, couldn&039;t exercise like I used to, could hardly work. My doctor put me on Cymbalta 2 weeks ago and within 10 days, almost all my pain is gone I still have some numbness in my lower leg and foot but I am no longer taking Percocet and am weaning off the morphine for night time Cymbalta gave me back my life I hope it continues Thank you for this wonderful medicine','What a product, very effective','I started methadone a few days ago and oh my gosh have I been amazed  I have felt better in the last few days more than I have in the last couple of years  I have chronic pain and been on almost all the other opiates.  I fell into the opiate addiction myself.  I think methadone is a God send  I would suggest methadone to anyone batttling chronic pain issues.','I am 21 and I had bumps on my chin everyday since I was 16. I had tried EVERYTHING, including a Clarisonic, expensive face washes, creams, etc. Thankfully, my dermatologist prescribed my Atralin and my skin is practically perfect. I had an initial break-out for about a week and a half, then suddenly my skin was perfect. No bumps and so smooth It does make my face rather shiny, which I am not used to since I have dry skin. I am so happy with this product It is so nice to wake up every morning with great skin. This is worth the price tag. I wash my face nightly with Bobbi Brown &quot;extra balm rinse&quot;, use this gel, then apply a heavy moisturizer. Get Atralin It will change your life','HORRIBLE experience w Loryna. Took it for acne, on the 3rd week and my skin is as bad as it was on the Mirena IUD. Giving me terrible anxiety and mood swings. The acne is killing me','Took it for a year or so, but now I need it again and my insurance wont pay for it and my other medicines are over $400.00 a month and they want $160.00 more for Crestor. We just can&039;t do it.','I had a bad experience each time I tried it.  I have been on Ambien for many years, but my Dr wanted to try something else. The Rozerem made me extremely anxious, and did the opposite of what I needed it for My heart beat fast, and I had a feeling of nervousness and anxiousness. I tried it 4 times, and it was the same all 4. Maybe I&039;m allergic.','having the nexplanon put into my arm was virtually pain free. I did have the bruising and tenderness around the injection site. No symptoms for the first month. Maybe a headache here and there. I have started bleeding though and it&039;s been every day for 9 days now. It&039;s not enough to be a full blown period but I have had painful cramping the first 5 days, more than with my normal period. I am optimistic tho and hope I will eventually have no period.','This is my first birth control I have ever been on. I&039;ve been on this pill going on two years. It does its job in the field of preventing pregnancy.  The only thing I dislike about it is I get very moody at times while on it,  if I skip a pill and have to double up on it the next night I get a real bad headache I have experienced weight gain as well, which no girl cares for. But like they all say every one is different.','I&039;ve been taking 10mg Cialis daily for the last six months. I can&039;t say enough about how much it has helped with erectile dysfunction. Erections are firm and last long enough for two orgasms. I&039;ve discovered something else while taking Cialis. I have been dealing with symptoms of depression for several years. I&039;ve tried several of the anti depressant medications but had terrible side effects. Not to mention, it made the performance issue worse. Since taking Cialis I&039;ve noticed my depression has all but disappeared. I did some research and discovered that some studies have reported that Cialis has helped with depression in men. I&039;ve got my life back and feel great.','I have been on this medication for a couple of days now and it is to heal my stomach lining which was scratched from acid reflux after having an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EDG) done. This medication is to heal the stomach and made it so that it heals it well and protects it from ever coming back is what I&rsquo;m told from the doctor. The only thing I have noticed so far from this medication is that it does give you dry mouth and a dry throat it is always best to keep your mouth clean and ice water helps a lot. The other thing is if you go to Walmart and buy BIOTENE dry mouth moisturizing spray works excellent After brushing and rinsing your mouth you can also use a lip moisturizer if it irritate your lips also finding that you drink  lots Water Yo','10 months no change total waste of $7000','The best BC I&039;ve tried I&039;m taking it for one month and have minimal side effects. My breasts slightly increased in size, but no weight gain or acne. I&039;m taking it at night, so I don&039;t know if there are any headaches or nausea, I don&039;t have any during the day. Love it','My daughter has been taking this medicine for several months for the treatment of Urticaria, and it&039;s had NO effect.','I went to a water parks and couple of days later I got a yeast infection just like the previous year ...so I finally decided no more damn water parks. So I noticed this one was serious, I was swollen,itching, and hurting . I cried to my husband all day. We went and go some pills I would take those 3 times a day... didn&039;t really help much . So he got me the cream to insert and I was soooo scared (I didn&039;t know why) so I slowly put the cream inside of me slowly pushing it all out of the applicator .... not even a minute went by and the itching and burning was sooooooo unbearable...I instantly got into the shower trying to wash it out. The water helped a lot and once I got out I felt a lot better. We shouldn&039;t have to go thru this for relief','This pill was a nightmare for me. I had random hot flashes that would last 2-3 hours and I would need to lay down immediately or go to a quiet place sit down and get some air. I also had random loss of appetite, I would be super hungry order a huge meal and then boom, hunger gone. I&039;m putting my last pack on fire.','Only used this to cure my UTI so it wouldn&039;t spread to a kidney infection. But the side effects are absolutely horrific I can&039;t deal with this much longer. I&039;m supposed to take 500mg/3x a day for 7 days but I&039;m cutting it short I&039;ll do it for 5 days because it&039;s day 3 and I already want to stop it.

I&039;m almost 21 and can&039;t fit into anything and afraid to wear shorts or anything cause of all the stretch marks. I get itchy where the rod is and it doesn&039;t stop.

Over all I love it, easy to remember, no side effects, haven&039;t got pregnant in 6 years I have been married. My periods since I am on it are regular and I know exactly when is coming. Before it they used to be long and heavy, with a lot of cramps, now they last 3-4 days max with only 1-2 days of regular bleeding and the rest is light. I only get 1 day of cramps (the heaviest day) and I get sensitive (not sore) and heavy boobs before my period comes. When I did came off I was so sensitive, I had sore boobs and my body was crazy.','I too have been experiencing dramatic weight loss with buspar. Just read the last comment and pretty much spot on. I don&039;t get hungry anymore. I&039;m a 5&039;7&quot; female who weighed 175lbs. and now I&039;m down to 120lbs. After two   months of this medicine. Also I noticed I seem to be having some severe OCD thoughts while taking this medicine. In the beginning it was all smooth sailing and now it seems like it&039;s not working. Going to try another medicine.','I wish this was around back when I was in high school  I have struggled with acne for my whole teen/adult life.  I have taken Yaz on and off for 8 years now, and my skin never looks better than when I&039;m on Yaz.  The doc took me off last year because I was getting headaches and she was concerned the estrogen in the Pill was causing it, but after a year on the mini pill with the same frequency of headaches and the added terribleness of deep cystic acne, I am happily back on Yaz and already seeing an improvement in my skin.  Only complaint (mainly from my husband) is a slightly lowered sex drive.','It worked okay for my back pains, but during the time that I first started taking it I got a really bad sore throat and if it wasn\%u2019t for Mobic, I would not have been able to get out of bed.  My throat felt so bad that I could hardly talk or eat and drink, but after taking the Mobic, it took the pain away for about 3 to 4 hours before I had to take another.  Therefore, if you have a bad sore throat or any inflammatory conditions try Mobic to see if it helps.','Neupro patch is the BOMB  My RLS bothers me even during the day, but with Neupro slow release patch, no leg jitters. AWESOME   I just can&039;t say enough about it. My provider has been giving me samples, so I have not had to pay as of yet, I just hope it isn&039;t very expensive, would hate to not be able to continue use due to the out of pocket cost.','I dont really use laxatives in my life but because I felt a bit constipated I took two pills( thought 1 will not be enough due to its size) and at 5 am got really bad cramps, and lots of regrets. No more laxatives for me, not worth the pain. By the way, it took just 3-4 hours for the pill to kick in, a way shorter interval of time expected.','Pristiq did a good job reducing my symptoms dramatically. However, it gave me so much in return, which made my life complicated I mean 50 lb weight gains over a year that keeps growing every month. I also cannot sleep at night as I could before. I see very vivid dreams and nightmares almost every night It makes me wake up feeling tired. In addition, I had withdrawal symptoms when I once forgot to take my dose. I had vertigo, nausea, headache. I absolutely could not function. ','Unreal difference.  My side effects are minimum and I&039;m on 60 mg a day.  This is one stop shopping.  I had terrible acne--cysts everywhere.  I&039;m 3 months in and it&039;s almost completely gone.','Was prescribed for anxiety, and instead it threw me into the worst full blown panic attack I have ever had.   Totally out of my mind','Caused breathing problems.','I have been on this birth control for 11 months now. At first I experienced moodiness and being over-emotional, and I still do sometimes whenever I start my new pack. However, my periods are so much lighter and only last from Wednesday to Sunday. Coming from somewhere who has had nightmare periods (such heavy bleeding that I would miss school) this is a great plus. My skin has also cleared up tremendously. I had my face under control but I would always get back acne, and I don&039;t break out on my back anymore. I have also gone up two cup sizes and I&039;m definitely not complaining. Also, it does its job on preventing pregnancy','Well yesterday I found out I had genital herpes from oral sex. My boyfriend had a cold sore that I honestly thought didn&039;t matter and I thought it was healed. I noticed symptoms such as itching and burning but I shook it off and thought it was a yeast infection. then the next day swelling happened and I was so sore I couldn&039;t sleep. My gyno perscribed me with Valacyclovir and so far it has been working a little bit, it still burns to go to the bathroom but it&039;s only the first day. It&039;s providing relief though. none of you should feel alone because you definitely aren&039;t. Just remember to stay positive and keep your head up. It sucks but you can do it Also remember that one little mistake can hurt you real bad.','I started taking this medicine in 2006. It works to take the pressure off my heart but it has caused me arthritis in my knees, hands and feet.  Now I am in pain most of the time.  My hands have developed arthritis in both thumbs, my feet have it in my toes.  I tried another Astra Zeneca product called Atacand and it works better but is so expensive I can&039;t afford to buy it.','After a few years of being diagnosed with narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness, someone I knew who had narcolepsy as well recommended I ask my doctor about Xyrem. I am glad I did because about a week after taking it I started feeling normal again.  I still have some &quot;bad&quot; days,  but they are better than my best days prior to taking Xyrem.  The only thing I don&039;t like is their list of side effects being unclear. I have had stomach issues, loss of appetite, and significant weight loss. I was beginning to think something was wrong with me because these are not side effects listed on their website. It wasn&039;t until I stated searching other forums that I am finding others having these same types of symptoms.','I love this medicine. It has helped so much with the arthritic pain. No side effects for me. I have eye check ups every six months. Give a try','I have been on this medicine for approximately one and a half weeks and it has improved my colitis immensely so far but I don&039;t think I can continue to use it because of the cost. ','I have always been a small person but now I am 23 lbs. overweight for the 2nd go around again. I thought I would try Alli instead of going to get a prescription this time. It cost me $62.00 plus. I have been using it for 3 weeks and it does absolutely nothing to help curb your appetite, if anything, I seemed to eat more. So I thought I would try taking more than the suggested, well that did nothing either. I will report that there were no side effects or illness or anything like that which I have read on some postings. Alli was a big waste of money for me and I will just have to go and get a prescription again, which does work. Alli is Not a substitute for a prescription diet pill, no matter what it states.','I used this medication years ago for my migraines.  Since that time, my husband has joined the Army and we have moved several times, etc.  Each time we do, I have to start all over again with my migraine treatments (I have hemi-palegic migraines) and I would give my eye-teeth for one of these doctors to just let me take Stadol NS again  It worked so well mainly because even when I was nauseated, I would still &quot;keep&quot; this medication because it was in the nasal spray form.  This medicine was a wonder drug for me... oh how I wish it could be again.','Works on my absessed tooth but side effects are bad, nausea, fatigue, severe diarrhea and malaise.','Unbelievably good.','Yow guys  Tested + on April &039;14 with VL 37,000 after a major fever event.

Started Atripla 2 years later after testing + on April &039;16 with VL 399,000  (10 times higher than when diagnosed) and CD4 427. After 6 weeks taking Atrilpla my numbers are VL 474 (pretty amazing drop) and CD4 440. I was pretty happy with these results but my Dr wasn&039;t. He expected me to become undectetable as of now but asked me to continue for two more months to see more progress. Absolutely no side effects except for feeling a bit high the first week','Tingling, itching and numbness of my hands.  Sleeplessness leading to insomnia.  Higher glucose numbers no matter the diet nearing diabetes.','I started Saxenda on 9/1/16 and by 9/30/16 I had lost 18 pounds  I increased the dosage each week and until I started the 3mg dosage, I constantly felt nauseated.  Fortunately, this has stopped and I am not having any side effects.  I am not weighing myself - will let the doctor do this at the end of each month.','I suffered from severe headaches about two days after I started Yaz. The headaches continued almost every day.

ADD wasn&039;t as well known back then. I was diagnosed with hyper dyslexia. I always thought that it was strange because I didn&039;t see letters backwards but I just accepted it. I was officially diagnosed with ADD in my mid 20&039;s. I have taken most of the medicine options over the past 12 years including Concerta, Strattera, Adderall, Ritalin and Ritalin LA. Couldn&039;t sleep on Concerta, I was out of my mind with Strattera, Adderall was like popping caffeine pills and Ritalin was too high maintenance as it neutralized after 2-3 hours. Then I found Ritalin LA. It&039;s not the magic bullet but it&039;s the best that I have found so far. It costs me 10X generic but worth it.','My 7 year old son has severe ADHD, ODD, and anxiety. We started him on Vyvanse 20mg, Depakote twice a day, and Kapvay .1 in the evening last week. We were worried because he talked SO much like he was on speed, and ran around the house looking for paper, books, pens to write with and never sat still but he was very pleasant when we started the Vyvanse. However, he was Always saying I&039;m sorry for blurting, please, and thank you which was unheard of before starting the Vyvanse.  We were noticing around 4:00 the Vyvanse wearing off and the aggression and whining came back with a vengeance We added another .1 mg Kapvay after school with his Depakote and the result was AMAZING. He is pleasant ALL day long.','I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder about 6 years ago and had my share of trying different medications to get it under control. After multiple trials with medicines my doctor finally found the right combination for me (Lexapro, lithium, (Depakote had sexual side effects), Synthroid, trazodone at night, multivitamins and B-1 vitamin). This combination worked great to get my mood swings under control. Once my mood swings were under control, I started having extreme anxiety attacks. I was then diagnosed with anxiety disorder as well. My doctor prescribed 0.75 mg Klonopin 3 times a day, as needed and it is a lifesaver. Klonopin knocks my anxiety down within 15 min. I have been taking it for 3 yrs with great results.','I started on liquid Prozac due to severe medicine sensitivities.  This has been a lifesaver.  I am currently on 2.5 mg and feel so much better.  My doctor would like me to get to 5mg, I will, but it will be slowly.  There is no one size fits all as far as dosage goes.  If you&039;re sensitive to medicines, think about liquid Prozac.  Easier to control dosages, minimal side effects.  Wonderful','I have been taking Loestrin 24 for almost a year now and at first I really haven&039;t had any problems with it. I loved it. I used to have my periods for a full 7 days straight and really heavy.  Now I only get it 2-3 days and its super light, which is AMAZING Some side effects I hate with it though is I get so emotional so easily.  Another this is I have absolutely no sex drive.  We went from doing it all the time to now once or twice a month. I feel bad but what can I do.  I always get my period the day I start the brown pill and now this month I haven&039;t gotten it.  I want the reassurance of getting it for at least a day so I don&039;t freak out thinking I&039;m pregnant.','This takes at least 6-8 week to kick in, but don&039;t just rely on the tablets. Make sure you drink lots of water and good food. I&039;ve noticed cheese makes my acne really bad. I&039;ve taken these tablets 1 year now, they help to an extent but I get the bad side effects, for some reason they make me need the toilet 4/5 times during the night, makes me wonder if they are trying to help my bladder as that&039;s what these tablets are for and my body is confused. Also get BAD headaches towards the end of the day, I&039;d say as severe as a migraine. So I&039;m now coming off them and going to a skin specialist instead. Not worth the headaches to me','In one sense it handled many of my symptoms, but I became a completely different person. I was no longer myself at all. I made many, many horrible decisions affecting my family friends, business, etc. I adopted a whole new set of values - i just wasn&039;t myself anymore. When I finally decided to go off it I spent 9 months of withdrawal symptoms, splitting capsules every day and gradually reducing the amount of grains. ','Clonazepam has drastically improved my life. I used to be afraid to go to sleep. I have seriously injured myself in my sleep in addition to harming others. After one night terror, I required surgery and decided it was time to see a sleep physician. A small dose of Clonazepam and I sleep great. Highly recommend.','My wisdom teeth are impacted and I have several cavities and I am waiting to have surgery. My doctor prescribed Vicodin for the pain and it works very well as long as I continue taking it every 6 hours.

First colonoscopy experience and I will make sure I NEVER have this stuff again in my entire life. First dose took a long time to choke down, but stayed down. The second dose not so easy. I took a good 3/4 of it (over quite a long period of time) and then the taste and medication overwhelmed me and I vomited. As I&039;ve seen here I recommend sucking on a lemon between sips and using a straw. BM&039;s are pretty much where they should be so I&039;m thinking all should be fine for procedure in a few hours. Only rating a 2 for effectiveness - every other aspect of this was completely unbearable.','I&039;m a 47 yr old female. This medicine greatly improved my attention. I was able to complete tasks at work. Organize my work and home. The problem was that my heart would beat rapidly at night keeping me awake. I stopped taking it when my blood pressure increased significantly.','I have been on this pill for 2 months. The first month was ok. I didn&039;t feel any different beside slight water gain. My first period did not come until the 4th day on the placebo pill. The 2nd month I had nipple tenderness every single day, which sucks because it hurts when I work out. My period did not come until the 3rd day on the placebo pill. I would say it is a good contraceptive besides the nipple tenderness. I had no other side effects. I am most likely switching to a different contraceptive due to the nipple tenderness.','Did not help my back pain','Unfortunately I am experiencing most of the bad side effects. I&039;ve had Implanon in for about 8 months and I have been bleeding non-stop. I have no sex drive whatsoever and have gained 30lbs. I made an appointment to get it removed because I can&039;t take this bleeding and weight gain. I&039;m depressed and have bad anxiety. Only good thing is that I haven&039;t gotten pregnant. This birth control just isn&039;t for me.','Worked for me and I can NEVER sleep. Only downfall is it takes so long to kick in. Woke up 7 hours later feeling fine.','Everytime I took Frova I ended up with rebound migraines for 2-3 days afterwards.  It simply wasn&039;t worth it for me and I went back to Imitrex, which doesn&039;t cause rebound migraines for me.','I took 50mg of Cozaar, 1 x daily for 5 days, had bad dreams, lightheaded and dizzy, and started having nosebleeds. I stopped taking it and I&039;m calling doctor today.','It completely worked for birth control. Even if I forgot to take it for a couple days, I never had a pregnancy. But the past 2 1/2 years i started to break out badly and I would feel a pain in the opening of my vagina during sex. It literally felt like I had a cut in a certain spot. I had it checked out immediately by my gynecologist and he couldn&039;t figure it out. I stopped sex for up to a month to see if it was something that needed to heal and it never went away. It was so painful I would almost cry every time and it made me scared to have sex. I never once thought it could be the pill but I recently stopped taking it just to take a break and that pain went away in a week And I also got pregnant within a month of stopping too.','Works Great I will never use anything else.   2nd time on it. Just had my third planned baby and also breastfeeding.','I have suffered from severe anxiety (GAD) and was taking more and more Klonopin as time went on.  I am very sensitive to medication and have tried many different SSRI/SNRI&039;s through the year with horrible side effects.  Finally, I had DNA testing to see what I would respond to and the result was Pristiq.  I started it several months ago in a small dose (I split the pills even though they say don&039;t do this) and within a few days my anxiety literally went away.  I was able to cut my Klonopin in 1/2 over a two month period.  The first week or two I was extremely tired but that passed.  The only side effect I get from time to time is migraines.  It still amazes me that my anxiety has disappeared.  I no longer keep Klonopin in my  pocket','I started Belviq with the free 15 day prescription.  After the 15 days, I had only lost 4 pounds.  I decided to get the 30 day prescription since it was only $75 with the Belviq savings card.  I think I will try it for a month or two to see how it goes.  I haven&039;t really experienced any side affects, other than my blood sugar being way lower than normal, which is a good thing, although I&039;m not really sure why, as I feel I am eating as much as before.  Some days it seems I get fuller quicker than normal when eating, but I still get as hungry as I ever did before.  I will be getting back to more regular exercise soon, so I hope that will help too.  I only gave it a &quot;5&quot; for now, until I see how it goes.  Fingers crossed','Was prescribed this medication while in the US Virgin Islands, for UTI. Doctor prescribe me 7 days worth two pills each day. I&039;ve been taking the prescribed dose and have not felt much better except for one full the day before yesterday. I&039;m back in the States now and I&039;m continuing to take the medication since you should not start taking your antibiotics unless your doctor tells you to but I am going to go to my family doctor tomorrow and figure out why I&039;m now peeing blood and have small bloody deposits when I urinate.','Great medicine--I tried tons of other treatments and was down to my last option, I was at 300 MG and it started to work with few side effects besides increased appetite and a little more tired at first-a lifesaver','Been on Duloxetine for 4 weeks now at 30 mg. First day had terrible diarrhea,  then felt groggy and almost in a dream like state for the first week. I was prescribed Cymbalta for migraines and general anxiety. Week 2 started to feel more normal but my anxiety was worse (to be expected). Week 3 I  noticed my migraines were less frequent and I tolerated the pain better, also started feeling happier and less anxious. Week 4 my anxiety is almost gone n migraines have gone from daily to maybe every 3 or 4 days and are less severe. Worth the first two weeks of feeling crappy.','I&039;m still in the early stages of taking XYREM (week 6), but it has changed my life. I almost never take naps, and have had my narcoleptic episodes significantly reduced.  I get around 8 hours of sleep every night, and can stay awake with no issues all day. Sometimes in the morning I feel a little groggy, but can&039;t get back to sleep which i&039;m sure is just the medicine wearing off as it goes away shortly after I get up and about.','Depression has got worse causing me to miss work. Have been on 20 different antidepressants over 7 years. Pristiq didn&039;t help at all for me, headaches, foggy and nausea. Also shaky at times.','I have weened off of Effexor 150mg and 75 mg over the past 3 weeks. I started Cymbalta 30 mg 2 days ago and was still have horrible adverse effects coming off of the Effexor. Effexor worked great for my anxiety and severe PMDD, but was making me extremely sluggish. I have also had chronic back pain for the past 7 years and my doctor wanted to switch me to Cymbalta. Well, the transition/withdrawal has been terrible. A lot if crying and panicking for no reason, crawling skin, etc. I took one Vistaril, and found it very helpful.  My Dr. has prescribed Vistaril 25-50 mg every 6 hours as needed. Has been a God send to help my anxiety during this transition. It also has been very helpful for my sons anxiety as well.','I&039;ve been on 150mg of lithium for 3 days, after 5 days I&039;ll be on 300mg and then gradually go up. I&039;ve suffered from bi polar &amp; depression for over 10 years, I&039;ve been on 15 different antidepressants, antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. Nothing seemed to even stabilize me. The past few months I&039;ve gotten so bad to where I&039;ve thought about suicide constantly. I was so depressed, easily irritated and cried over the littlest thing. Lithium has so far, saved me. I feel the best I&039;ve felt in a LONG time I have no side effect as of yet. My mind is completely cleared of any negative thoughts. Although it&039;s only been 3 days I&039;m hopeful things will keep getting better from here. I&039;m so glad I tried lithium','All I have to say is UGH. I haven&039;t taken birth control in about 4 years and I decided it was smart for me to go back on it. I&039;ve been on Apri for about 2 weeks now and I am totally not myself. I feel so sad and depressed. I have also had random crying spells. Appetite hasn&039;t increased at all but my skin has broken out. My skin has been super itchy all over since I&039;ve been on it and I&039;ve been getting stomach pains and headaches. Birth control does work different for everyone but I definitely plan on switching to a new birth control when this pack finished.','It&039;s day 6 and the side effects are really kicking I&039;m nauseous to the point where I think I&039;m pregnant and have to vomit, my headaches are increasing but I only have one more day so I think I can hang in there. Overall my symptoms of bv are gone but the medicine just makes me sick','Hey,  So I took the ellaOne about 7h after the condom slipped. It cost about 35&euro;. The first 3 days I didn&039;t have any side effect exceppt major sickness but I think I was sooo nervous that I could not eat anything. DONT WORRY I WAS DEVASTATED AND SO HORRIFIED FOR TWO WHOLE WEEKS BUT IT WORKED I am so happy Don&039;t worry you are gonna be okay :* But after the first 3 days my skin got soo bad and I had a lot of cramps but hey, worth it. I got my period about 3 weeks late - all ok ;)','I was first put on abilify in 2004. It is very effective, and has been the most useful medication for me. I have developed gallstones, have a fatty liver and have high triglycerides. It is definitely not because of my diet. I was a vegan for 23 years and I am very strict with what I eat. I now have to get my gallbladder removed and I think it has to do with taking psychiatric drugs over the years. It is well noted now that abilify causes gallstones, a fatty liver and high triglycerides. I have been in constant pain for three months and just now, after 12 years of taking abilify, may discontinue the use and start something new. Overall, for the mood disorder this was highly effective and useful in treating my bipolar depression.','My doc switched me to this due to some issues with morphine sulphate ER 15mg three times a day.  He put me on the Hysingla ER at 20mg once a day with the oxy 15mg x2 for breakthru pain.  Been on it for two days and am in constant pain at a 6/7 level.  With the other med I was 4/5 on bad days. So disappointed not too mention the cost is more than double for me.  Don&039;t know if the dose is just two low considering how long I&039;ve been on pain meds  Guess I could ask him to up it to 40mg and see if that works.  20mg isn&039;t hacking it at all.  So tired of the government sticking its nose into my health.','I&039;ve been on Sprintec for two months now and my doctor had told me that if I wanted to skip my period I could just skip over the white and jump right into the next pack. So after deciding to do so I&039;ve been bleeding for the past week now unexpectedly throughout the day. I have never had acne before but now that I&039;ve been on Sprintec my forehead has been spotting. Also my breasts have become larger I believe but sore to touch almost everyday. I have gained about 10lbs from it, and my sex drive is gone about halfway through activity. And I&039;ve also been feeling bloated. I&039;m not totally  satisfied with the product but not totally dissatisfied since it obviously works. Debating going off it though.','Took this for about 4 years and had throat swelling, feeling like something wrapped around my neck, swallowing issues and hoarseness. Blamed it on an operation to remove a cyst in my neck but the symptoms were not from that procedure according to my ENT. I  stopped using it for two years and as my COPD worsened my doc put me back on it. Bang those symptoms came right back. I am now on Tudorza and doing better without those side effects.','I was diagnosed with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia in October of 2010. I was prescribed 600 units of Tasinga per day - 300 AM, AND 300 PM.  I was in remission in 12 days - thank GOD.  I am on Medicare and get help with my co-pay from PSI.  I have mild nausea when I first take the pills, mild constipation and some shortness of breath, but I also have COPD.  I have, been taking Tasinga for 2 1/2 yrs now and am just starting to notice my hair is thinning. I was told I have to take it for life. I thank GOD everyday for this medicine and will gladly endur the minor side efforts in exchange for a longer life.     ','I had unprotected sex two days after my period, I took the plan b one step less than 24 hours later and low and behold it did not work. I even got the symptoms from the pill a week later. I was bleeding like a period for 4 days. And took 5 at home pregnancy tests which all very lightly came back positive. I called plan b&039;s number on the box and reported my experience. They took down the information and pull number on the box. Let me tell you people....please just use a condom. I just found out yesterday I was pregnant and I&039;m Now a mess. Please be safe and don&039;t rely on your partner to be safe because I thought it was obvious he needed to pull out. (Sorry for being graphic) :(  to be honest I dont think plan b even works.','I developed eczema when I turned 70. I started dupixent with my initial dose 9 days ago. After about 3 days I thought it was working because my itching subsided about 50 \%. However I am sad to say that my condition has flared up again. I will continue treatment for 1 to 2 months and reassess but so far I am deeply disappointed.','Ativan is a great medicine and glad my psychiatrist prescribed me 1 mg 2 times a day. Though I use that as well as Klonopin but Ativan gets me to sleep sometimes and Klonopin keeps me asleep. Overall I believe its a God send.','It is phenomenal  I put on weight fast, you start to see and feel results so quickly  It&039;s very motivating feeling   I have gained 14 pounds so far since late March early April ...I&039;m 5&quot;6,  I started at 146, I am now 160, my goal weight is 175. I think that will give me the full figured , curvy look I want. If you&039;re serious about your weight this is the solution  Good luck ','I got my implant put in December 9 ,2015 and today is January 4,2016 my last period wasn&039;t a period I mainly spotted and agreed for about week and half I discharge brown discharge and a few head aches still have few head aches I&039;ve also gained weight just a few pounds so far I like it I would refer it to anyone who doesn&039;t want kids for the next 3 years','I have to weigh in about this med.  When you first start it, it is a wonder drug.  At some point, you will either need more, or you will suffer from tolerance withdrawals.  There are justifiable horror stories about this drug. Taking it for a week or two, no problem.  More than 2 weeks, it&039;s hard to get off it.  I have been weaning off for about 4 months.','I have always hurt taking statins and refused for over 15 yrs to take more than a few weeks, because side effects of pain, aching, memory loss. Heart doctor and family doctor pushed me into taking Repatha as my cholesterol was 553. September2016, I tried it and first 2 injections were ok, no side effects. but as soon as I took the third I have been in the most pain I have experienced in my life. Every joint, tendon, muscle, from my neck to my toes. It is now December27,2016 and the pain has just increased instead of decreased. If I lay down or sit for just a while I can hardly move when I get back up. I never had problems in my hands or knees before but feel like I could fall when walking. and hands feel numb with tingling and pain.','Still hard after a few consecutive daily doses','I have always been vulnerable to bronchitis and pneumonia.  This antibiotic is the only thing that works.  It leaves a bad taste in my mouth yes but I know that after 10 days I will be done and better.  Before I was prescribed this, I would often have to take more then 10 days of antibiotics in order to get better.','Most of my life I have struggled with severe panic attacks, general anxiety, PTSD &amp; moderate depression. Been on meds twice before until I felt better &amp; then I would stop taking them. This last time it had been close to a year that I had been suffering again before I decided to reluctantly go back on meds. I tried Celexa again- it worked kinda okay in the past but this time it made no improvement for me. Saw the doc who switched me to Prozac- all I can say is WOW Best yet- I feel like my old, happy self after only 1 month 10mg the first week, 15 the second and 20mg the last two. Give it time to work &amp; be patient- it might make you feel a bit off &amp; not better at first, but it is a miracle drug. These bad feelings will pass hang in there','Working well so far (on second injection). Less hassle than regular injections or gels and I don&039;t have to worry about transferring it to my girlfriend.','I tried just about everything for depression and venlafaxine was one of the only drugs to help. I was so depressed that I jumped off a building for a suicide attempt. I wound up paralyzed in a wheelchair. Venlafaxine took a while to work about 3 moths or so. I first took 75mg but didn&039;t do much. It wasn&039;t until I reached 375mg that I felt the true effects of the drug. Very very strong antidepressant effects. My mind is clear and I&039;m feeling a warm glow all day. My depression so anxiety are gone even though I&039;m paraplegic I am happy. Wish they gave this drug to me a long time ago I would not be In a wheelchair. You have to really be patient and find the right dose abs then one day you&039;ll wake up and feel great.','I&039;ve been on every antidepressant known to mankind and they were awful to me. Either the side effects were too bad or it turned me into a complete zombie to the point work was out of the question, and then my dr said we would try one more called Prozac and the reason he had not prescribed it before was because it took 6-8 weeks to reach full effect as where the others took less then half that time. I started out taking 10mg because I have always been very sensitive to antidepressants and their side effects. For about the first 2 or 3 weeks I experience light anxiety... Then finally the 6 weeks passed and still nothing, but then finally about 8 weeks into the mediation, I feel like Santa Clause on steroids It has saved my life ','I went on it with my BP at 145/100 several years ago and it lowered it while eating a standard American diet. A few years ago, I started eating a whole foods diet (limiting processed foods) and had to take myself off the medicine because I would become faint when standing up.    Fast forward to a trip to Vegas in March of 2015. I went off the bus and fell back into the standard american diet having long ago stopped regularly monitoring my BP.  Four days ago, I woke up with a headache and called parents to inform them that wouldn&039;t be making to Turkey Day dinner. Still had some pills remaining and took 50mg a day since along with 2 day fast and eating whole foods again. It&039;s down to 124/80 after being at 201/113 four days ago. I&039;m reducing to','I was just diagnosed in my 40&039;s with generalized anxiety disorder not surprised.  I was always having anxiety/panic attacks and unable to function some times.  I now take Celexa daily and while it takes about 2 months to really kick in my anxiety is gone and I feel FAR beyond how I have felt in forever.  Zoloft nor prozac worked.  I don&039;t know they are truly geared towards anxiety.  High;y recommend it at 10mg if not feeling better.','Worst decision ever Got depo shot after 6wks postpartum thinking it was the most convenient birth control method. Oh, so wrong. Got it 4-17-15, started bleeding 5-1-15, a month after I am still bleeding.  Limited sex due to period bleeding, it&039;s not pretty. Terrible mood swings. Increased cravings for sweets and junk food, dizziness, very tired and sleepy. Well its a horror story. I am not going back for a 2nd shot, no way. I will never get another shot of this medicine that transformed me in to a non stop bleeding witch.','I started Victoza today. At only 0.6 mg. I felt so undeniably and utterly  unwell that I cannot imagine even trying it for a second day.     In summary, severe low blood sugar symptoms,  ravenously hungry  and I was also prescribe this for weight loss as well as diabetes,  headache, no energy, and a general feeling of being very not well.   In short I do not recommend this to anyone.','My Doctor gave me 2 weeks of Abilify, 2mg as a sample to take in addition to my 450mg of Wellbutrin. Made me extremely dizzy and had difficulty driving safely due to this. ','After 13 years of untreated depression, anxiety and panic attacks I decided to finally ask for help.  That came in the form of 10mg Citalopram for the first week, 20mg for another month and boosted up to 30mg for the next few months.   In that time I had nothing but bad side effects. Instead of feeling depressed and sad I just got grumpy and mad, I had trouble with my sex drive/performance and the insomnia was ridiculous. My partner told me I had changed since starting the medication.   I have since come off all medication and living happily without.','I had a severe skin infection, and I used this medication and I had no issues.  I was told not to overdose by taking the medicine to close together but altogether a positive experience.  VERY Pricey though, that&039;s the only downfall.','The reason I&039;m giving it a 9 instead of 10 is because of it&039;s side effects. Otherwise, this patch works really well for an overnight or two day fishing trip (at least in my experience). I thought I&039;m getting cold and feeling sick after I get off the fishing boat because my throat was getting dry and dryer and dryer. At that time I&039;m not aware that one of it&039;s side effects was dry mouth/throat. Aside from that, I didn&039;t feel anything anymore after couple of days. I&039;ll use it again for my next fishing trip. I&039;ll opt for a dry throat verses getting sick on the boat.','It works well for TSH supression','Epiduo is amazing. I tried all sorts of acne creams and this one is like a blessing. I went to my dermatologist and she gave this for me to use This is my second week and most of my pimples have eased and are gone. I&039;m impressed with this product and I will keep using it.','You&039;re supposed to inject this under skin not in the muscle.  I have Transverse Mylytis and was just diagnosed w relapsing MS. Been getting shots but for some reason they stopped today and its only been 7 days','I have read so many things and do not know what to believe. I have post traumatic stress disorder and have taken sleep aides from the health food store which left me with Vertigo and not feeling well. I have not had any of the usual  side effects with Ambien and it leaves me refreshed however I do have one weird side effect and I was not sure at first if it was the Ambien. But it is. I am usually a person who is cold and likes the heat. But I have gotten heat sick several times and living in NYC where there is no air and we are constantly having heat waves it has made me sensitive to heat. I am super sensitive and usually if there is a side effect to be had I get it but really I have not had anything except the heat exhaustion. I mean  sweating, etc.','Two years ago, I couldn&039;t sleep, my doctor gave me all type of sleep meds, nothing worked. The only med works is this. I take 5mg every night on and off for 2 years. No side effect.','I am currently taking Minocycline and I just got a face peel a week ago.  A few days after my face peel, my face still wasn&039;t improving very well. I started using my Epiduo cream and my face is almost completely clear.  It has made my face dry and it burns pretty bad, but with lotion, it isn&039;t bad at all.  I am very impressed. I am sure that the medication and the face peel has both made an impact on my face, but the Epiduo is helping a lot  I was skeptical of using this product since I have read that the acne will get worse before it gets better. That has not happened to me.','It seems to work for generalized anxiety when taken in large doses twice a day (for me anyway). It does seem to cause weight gain though.','I starting taking Zoloft 8 weeks ago. I was extremely stressed out and was suffering from PTSD due to a bad car accident. After about 1 1/2 wks I really noticed a difference. Not stressed anymore but I do feel a bit Zombie like. I also have a problem with memory and focusing. Also really tired at night. Overall right now I guess it is worth the trade off. Also have intestinal issues but hope it will go away.','It works fine. I eat first then take the pill with 15-30 mins gone. Doesnt make you sleepy. ','I was on this birth control for about 8 months straight and I went off now I am currently back on and I absolutely love it. No weight gain, no acne, lighter shorter periods. The only thing is when I first started taking it, I spotted for a month, which is normal. Other than that, I love it.','I have currently started taking Keppra for the last week and a half. I have experienced numbness and tingling throughout my whole body, along with what feels like electrical impulse shocks. I&039;m tired all the time, trouble sleeping. I can only hope that these side effects will cease because the side effects are making me feel really bad, just the same way as I did with Dilantin I was taking. ','joint pain, no energy, no enthusiasm for social life, tiredness, weakness, low appetite.  Femara is extending my life. I know this since I have been in remission for 5 years after taking Femara. My breast cancer started in right breast 32 years ago. Chemo and Radiation therapy stopped it for 22 years but 5 years ago it matastasized to lung and bones. This is when the oncologist prescribed Femara. I&039;m now in my &quot;golden&quot; years, a widow for 16 years but determined to find relief for this pain and relief from this depression so I can be happy and enjoy life.','I started taking this medication 10 years ago. My doctor told me it was non-narcotic and non-habit forming.  Up to that time I had never had any addictions to drugs or alcohol, but unfortunately I am dependent on this drug for sleep.  It does however work very well with few side effects and I wake up feeling refreshed.  ','I&039;ve had skyla in for about a year now, and it is by far my favorite form of birth control. Some background info, I&039;m 19 and have never had kids. Other birth controls affected my mood greatly, and Skyla has not affected my mood in the slightest. I also did not experience any weight gain. The only downside is my period is longer than it was before (10 days, but not heavy) and I experience cramping, but nothing midol can&039;t fix. I can&039;t even remember the pain from the insertion process now (which I got while not on my period), but that slight discomfort for a couple days it worth it for the next 3 years of birth control.','Hello, I am 27 and started having psoriasis when I was 20. I am covered 80\%. My rheumothogist has started me on methotrexate shot once a week as well as folic acid everyday but the day of the shot. I am currently on day 5, my skin has stopped forming layers about 90\% but still red and small patches here and there. From the time I got the shot, I have only felt low energy and low appetite. No serious side effects. I must add before going on methotrexate, you should start eating healthier and detox the body the best you can for a month prior to going on methotrexate. If you don&039;t you are doing more harm than good because your immune system is going to sleep mode and if you got a load of junk and bad bacteria left they will just take over.','I&039;m taking this medication to regulate my period. I was scared after reading the side effects especially about the hair loss and the weight gain, but I know everyone is different. This is my 2nd month and I&039;ve experienced loss of appetite, stomach ache, nausea/vomitting the most...I&039;ve actually lost 10 pounds which is awesome. The neasea/vomitting is only about once a week so it&039;s not that bad...I just am not hungry anymore...which helps me make better choices in eating. My first month I was hormonal, however now I think my bodies gotten use to it so I&039;m not as hormonal. As far as my period...It hasnt been long enough to tell if it&039;s regulated.','I&039;ve had the Nexplanon for over 2 years and I absolutely love it.  The only issue I&039;ve had with it is my periods are very irregular which is no big deal for me. I get a period for 2 weeks and then I&039;m period free for about 4 months, then it will return. I have no problem with that. I plan on using this birth control method for 5 more years. I love it.','This literally changed my life. I can now wear colorful shirts without worrying about sweat stains. It worked after the first application. My doctor said I&039;d experience &quot;mild itching&quot; and I wish she would&039;ve been more truthful and said &quot;practically unbearable itching&quot; but the longer I use this medicine, the less I itch. I don&039;t itch at all anymore when I put it on. If I use it daily, I get a dry, painful rash in my underarms so I use it every other or every 2 days.','I was born with Asthma had been in and out of hospitals since birth.  When I was old enough to use my own judgement on inhalers I decided to try Primatene Mist.  I have used it for over 20 years.  I only need to use it...maybe...2 times a month...if that.  NOTHING the doctors gave me ever worked.  Primatene Mist keeps me OUT of the hospital and home with my family.  ','Been on Testim for 2.5 months. Huge improvement in mood, and physical stature. Started working out again. I feel great Strong and sexy. Wife likes it too My libido has increased and the reaction from other females is incredible. I lost 25 lbs prior to starting and am now seeing my abs again. The energy is awesome as I motivate a group for business part time. Love the smell. Application is a daily chore but worth it.','I received this from the pharmacy a couple of different times. Each time, I fully expected it to work like &039;Alesse&039;, used to work for me. Alesse, in my past, would quell my endometriosis pain, &amp; bloating, so wonderfully. This lutera, each time I used it, puffed, &amp; bloated me up SO much, that I swear it&039;s NOT the same ingredients as Alesse. It felt like a totally different god awful pill. It felt like I perpetually, was in PMS mode; bloated to a highly uncomfortable level Something is amiss with this pill. Whether it even has levenorgestrel in it, is debatable. It needs to be scrutinized on what level of estrogen is in there, too, since generics do not have to be exact. It had horrible side effects for me. Aviane seems to work much better','I just started tegretol 2 days ago in conjunction with Cipralex and Clonazapam. I&039;ve taken the last two mentioned for years up until a few months ago and never had side effects so I know the side effects are from the Tegretol.  No appetite. Nausea, and severe migraines. Definitely making me more hopeful and less suicidal and less impulsive, but I just hope the physical symptoms go away soon. I&039;ve never been on Tegretol before.','Fell asleep easily. Stayed asleep all night. No hangover.','I have only been on Jolivette for a month after my daughter was born. First of all she is 2 months old and in that entire time I have been on a period except for 3 days of very light spotting. I feel like I&039;m going to bleed forever. It&039;s not heavy it just doesn&039;t stop. It also made my milk supply low which has me supplementing with formula and I have never had acne this bad in my life. My entire face is covered I am stopping use of this pill immediately. I would rather use condoms than deal with this nonsense. I&039;m having to use them anyway since you have to take the pill the same time everyday and I always forget. If I wanna get back on the pill I&039;ll take a normal one in 4-6 months when I&039;m done breast feeding.','I&039;ve been on Orsythia for a year and half and I&039;ve had a regular cycle twice I get it early and it lasts 7-12 days, and it&039;s just brown, not a true &039;period&039;. Recently I&039;ve started to get the bad acne everyone mentions. I&039;m 43 and have pimples on my chin and forehead (never had it before). It has eliminated my breast tenderness and cramping though - that&039;s why I strayed on it. But it&039;s just too unpredictable and so I changed to another birth control. I do not recommend it.','They gave me Stadol when I was in labor with my son. It made me hallucinate badly. ','Taking drug for about 5 years and blood pressure stays around 140/93.  All of a sudden started having ringing in ears and decided to go off Diovan after reading this was a side effect. Also noticed shortness of breath, weight gain and tiredness. Now blood pressure is about the same without Diovan or any other medication except still have the ringing in the ears.','Headache. Pressure in forehead.Itching. I only take the the med at bedtime, which is obvious because of other side effects as dizziness, and because I don&039;t drive at night.','This medicine made me unable to BREATHE I went to urgent Care to appease my boyfriend. He hounded me about taking the meds they prescribed even though I felt the intuitive urge not to... As soon as I took one, about 30 minutes later came a cough episode from hell, with my throat closing up. Thought maybe it was cold air. Took another one. Same thing. This time chest tightness and burning. I went to another urgent care where they gave me a breathing treatment and a z pack for suspected bacterial bronchitis. I came home and told my man I think it was a side effect of the meds. He said let me take one, I&039;ve been coughing a little let&039;s see if it works for me. 30 minutes later he had a migraine from hell and a fever. DON&039;T TAKE THIS TRASH','Today is my third day with flagyl for BV. I do have a weird taste in my mouth, when I brush my teeth and eat. To prevent yeast infection I eat yogurt, and take a probiotic powder packet that&039;s fizzy and you mix into water like an emergen-c packet. I also wear long dresses and nightgowns around the house without undies to help with air flow which heals and prevents yeast infections. It&039;s my health and going commando , taking flagyl, and drinking water to dilute the concentrated urine, all have been helpful in stopping side effects.','My eyes are very red and everyone thinks I have been smoking weed,-that&039;s how bad they look.  They hurt and are light sensitive.  I am going to ask to change to something else.  I can&039;t deal with this.','A little over two years due to a job change and move, I suffered many anxiety/panic attacks.  One of them landed me in the ER.  I was then diagnosed with depression.  I was put on Pristiq and with time it started working.  I took the medication for about 18 months and then very slowly went off.  I don&039;t like being dependent on medication.  My main reason for going off was my sex drive.  You are very limited as to what you can take while on antidepressants.  I am starting to feel like I am slipping into depression once again so will probably start again.  Pristiq worked wonders for me.','I took this around 9 pm. I fell right to sleep with no problems. It did not keep me up at all. I woke up and blew my nose, the medicine had worked. It cleared my nose after I blew it. However, the taste is disgusting and I still have a cough.','I have been on Azor for 7 days. I also started 60mg of Cymbalta the same night, I have had severe headaches from the time I get up until the time I go to bed, also diarrhea some times 4 times a day. Azor did stop the pulsating heartbeat sounds I was having in my ears, I will see me Dr. in a few days to discuss what is happening and if I should continue this medication, I previously was on Cymbalta with no side effects so I don&039;t believe my symptoms are from that medication.','I started taking this 2 years ago. I chose it because how easy it is to use and you don&039;t have to remember to take it every day. Big plus. On the downside I did gain some weight. I also have experienced mood swings and last summer I had sun spots on my face (NEVER had those before). I&039;m going to stop using it soon because I&039;m tired of the mood swings','I have a torn hip ligament due to a fall at work - I find NO relief with Voltaren either oral (75MG 2x per day) or the patch.','I decided to use this birth control after constantly changing oral contraceptives because they were just awful, mood swings and gained 30 pounds in 2 months. This has been the best birth control I&rsquo;ve been on. No weight gain. No periods. No mood swings.  I get acne around the time I should have a period each month. Also no pregnancy so that&rsquo;s good. I was skeptical to use this birth control after reading reviews. But it&rsquo;s been the best thing for me. I recommend this to anyone of my girl friends.','Bent over and lower back went out. Left shoulder was already hurting for months. No diagnosis but doctor started me on Mobic and PT. Back pain is gone after one month but both shoulders are so painful I can&039;t sleep at all. Having a lot of wheezing and just started running fever for no reason. I am thinking I may have to quit taking it.','Wrapping up week 8 with Pristiq. First depression treatment attempt, therefore unable to compare to similar drugs. Notable: elevated mood, on-and-off headaches, sleepiness, confusion, poor coordination, decreased appetite, consistent sex drive. Positive effects of drug definitely outweigh set backs. Thanks Pristiq. Everyone is different and therefore no two people are expected to react the same.','I started taking Humira after the Methotrexate became in-effective.  I WOULD NEVER TAKE THIS HUMIRA AGAIN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.  It began with headaches, which got worse every time I took the Humira.  My energy level went down to nothing, and it did not help my RA at all.  NOW, this drug has given me severe Eczema on my hands, feet, underarms, crotch and in my ear canals.  I have never been so miserable in my entire life.  They can&039;t help the eczema at all.  I have gone off Humira for over 2 months, I&039;m flaring, and I still have the eczema.  They tell me I might have it for life.  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.  I&039;d rather have RA pain, then all these debilitating side effects.  Funny, they never said a word about any of this.','I had no major side effects on this med &amp; it&039;s helped my anxiety &amp; depression. I&039;ve been taking it for 6 months. I titrated up to 20mg. The Med was helping my mood but I had diarrhea that wasn&039;t temporary so they put me on 10mg.  The 10mg is working just fine for me but I still get diarrhea every now &amp; then whereas I didn&039;t before starting Viibryd  Something peculiar- it seems since starting Viibryd, my guts are intolerant to veggies I ate fine before I started the med. Lettuces (even organic from the grocery not sprayed w/preservatives, cooked cauliflower etc run right through me now. It&039;s common for ppl to have this affect w/o this med but I never was sensitive. Not sure if there is a correlation. It&039;s not crampy so for now staying on Viibryd.','I think the use of putting perfume in the gel is really stupid. There are so many people allergic also someone like me with cancer and very sore and nauseated to spend money on this and it made me so sick I washed up 4 times and my hands and skin still smells strong. It gave me a headache and made my nausea worse. There is no need for perfume not to mention it&039;s just an toxic unnecessary ingredient. I will never use this again and I will be sure to let everyone at clinic know.','I am a 44 yr old female and I started taking 10mg twelve days ago.  The first week was really good.  I felt calmer, softer and less agitated.  I didn&039;t feel depressed but I did experience some minor GI issues (nothing I couldn&039;t deal with).  This week I feel slow and tired, unexcited about going to the gym anymore.  I can feel depression creeping back in.  I called the doctor today and asked if I could try going up to 20mg.  I&039;m hoping I can get back on track.','I was on Fetzima for a couple of months but my depression was still really bad. The doctor kept increasing my dose with no signs of improvement. Eventually, my blood pressure and pulse was so high that I had to come off.','This was my first birth control brand so I don&039;t have experience with other brands to compare it to, but I had some issues. I had heavy, two week long periods on this pill, sometimes even longer. Thinking this would eventually level off I stayed on it for a year but it never did. Needless to say, I&039;ve had more than enough of that Also, on this pill I felt paranoid about things that I never worried about before, I kept thinking something awful would happen whenever I left the house. I just switched bands so I&039;m hoping these symptoms stop, especially the paranoia and anxiety. On the plus, my skin never looked better and while the periods were long, I had  minimal cramping.','I&039;ve tried Prozac, Zoloft, Celexa and none of them worked well. They would work maybe a month and the depression crept back into my life. I started taking Viibryd and the recommendation of a doctor and trusted friend and my life has changed dramatically for the better. I don&039;t have the wiped out feeling and my sex drive has stayed the same. This medicine has been a God send for me. I had to fight to get my insurance to cover it but it has so been worth it.','I&039;m bipolar and this is the only medication (out of many, many) that really helps my bipolar and it works almost instantaneously for me.  I first went on it to gain weight because I was trying to recover from anorexia and struggling, but stayed on it for my bipolar.  I did gain weight and I eat tons, but I have a good metabolism and Zyprexa just brings me up to my medically ideal weight.','I started taking this after I had a child at age 17, and first, the side effects were minimum for me but I got a lot of weird bumps all over my hands that looked like warts, and the doctor said that I either had to wait them out or stop the pill. After 3 months they finally went away.    I took this for about a year. My husband and I have tried for the last 20 months to get pregnant, and it turns out now I&039;m all of a sudden infertile. I&039;ve already had one baby, so this was linked to Necon 1/35.','I was taking 300 mg of Seroquel XR for 6 months. The best part was being able to get a good night&rsquo;s sleep. I had only been getting 2-3 hrs rest each night. My mind would race and it was a struggle to stay in bed. I would get up and start cleaning. Additionally, I would spend hours creating plans to organize my life. I had not actually followed any of those plans and I was depressed. I took Latuda for a short period but it made my inability to sleep worse. That&rsquo;s when I was switched to Seroquel. I loved the way it helped me feel normal. The bad - I gained 30 lbs in 6 months. I asked to be taken off and started taking Geodon. Once again I cannot sleep. I am going to ask to go back to Seroquel XR and focus on following a healthy diet.','Expensive but it works No negative side effects.','Took sporanox for approximately seven months to cure complete infestation of toenail fungus (both feet/all toes). Sporanox had started to clear it all up when I ran out of the capsules. I was overseas and unable to get a refill. After stopping the medication for a period of time, the fungus returned to its previous state. Upon my return to the U.S. I did not pursue another Rx due to concerns over liver damage. But, if your liver is healthy and you can take it for an extended period of time, Sporanox seems to be a very effective cure. Much faster than topical meds I&039;ve used since then, although like I said soon after I stopped taking Sporanox the fungal infection returned to its previous state.','Do not get the shot. I got the shot a while ago at first everything was alright but then I got my period which I&039;ve had forever now it will not go away. I get the worst headaches that I&039;ve ever had before and they last all day and I get them everyday. I feel sick. And I also have started to feel super moody and sad out of no where. My body gets achey and I am starting to gain weight definitely will not be getting the shot again it&039;s not worth it.','The suggestion to chill the Suprep in fridge, chill your water, soda and or gatorade is great advice.  Yes use a straw.  I put a Lifesavor Peppermint in my mouth to prepare for the Suprep&039;s nasty taste, then I added cold water and ginger ale to the fill line in the cup provided.  Using a straw, holding my nose, I quickly drank the Supra with the peppermint Lifesaver between my gums and cheek so in between each sip I was able to get the nasty taste out of my mouth with the mint.    Having a lifesaver peppermint REALLY helps with the aftertaste  It&039;s my 3rd colonoscopy and this time I was actually able to get through it without gagging on the stuff.  Yes it is like metallic grape drink','I&039;m on 40mg a day, did take sertraline, mirtazapine now on these, don&039;t think they do anything to me, doctor says he don&039;t know if I got bi polar or schizophrenia lol, that&039;s what u get for being honest. did stop them once for week as thought doing nothing, never felt so ill in my life if that&039;s a cold turkey. I&039;m 35 anyone else on 40mg? ','Because I am a recovering alcoholic it is crucial for me to find non-narcotic treatment for the persevering pain of my chronic pancreatitis. I was feeling a bit hopeless with the repeated prescriptions of pain meds (which of course offer only temporary relief, and for me a danger of over-use), until my GI prescribed me Gabapentin. This med has been incredibly successful in mitigating my pain, while also giving me huge energy (I&039;m a consistent runner so this factor is welcomed), and allowing me to move forward with my sobriety. I give it four stars, though I realize like anything, it&039;s not for everyone. That said, good luck to you all with finding what works.','Expensive but worth it My uric acid was in the 9-10 range and I was having several severe gout attacks every year. I tried allopurinol but didn&039;t work, so started on Uloric 40mg about 6 months ago. Had a few minor attacks during the first 5 months, but since then I can eat or drink anything and doesn&039;t cause any flashes. Doctors office just called and the uric acid level was 4.8.','I was happy to find these reviews.  I read through them and got some idea of what to expect.  This is my 3rd colonoscopy but the first time with this prep.  It is by far much easier than the others  I cannot chug so I have to drink it in small amounts.  I chilled the prep, used a straw, and I bit into an orange wedge after every sip.  I don&039;t even know what the prep tastes like  because of biting into the orange after every drink.  Went down fast','Genetically, I am cursed with acne. For years as a young teen I struggled with acne on my forehead and cheeks. I tried every potion and cleanser out there, to no avail. When I went for my physical, my doctor noticed how bad my acne was and prescribed clindamycin gel, and boy has it worked wonders. I have very sensitive skin, yet this did not seem to make things worse. I have occasional breakouts, but my skin looks absolutely fantastic after 5 months of use.','For me this medication did absolutely nothing.. went back to my usual 2 daily Imodium after one miserable week of &quot;going&quot; almost nonstop. BUT even though is was useless for me I say try it out, we are all different.  Best wishes to us all.','I am a 46 year old male. In 1988 I was going through a very serious bout with anxiety and depression. Luckily - there was a place called Freedom From Fear on Staten Island that was able to counsel me (free of charge, as was affiliated with Columbia University), and a doctor there prescribed for me a new drug that was just approved and available...Prozac. I took it for eight months or so and recovered - so much so that it helped me deal with the tragedy of my mother dying only a year later. Yes, this medicine saved my life. This is are the reason I am here right now. I only took the medicine for that eight months, and slowly got off it. Here I am 20 years later, totally fine','This stuff is great for nerve pain. I have 2 herniated discs in my lower back and 1 in my neck along with a pinched nerve. It takes away my neck pain when narcotic pain relievers and muscle relaxers combined didn&039;t. Taking it alone causes drowsiness. ','Only medication that stops my nausea and vomiting during a migraine. I&039;ve tried everything too. Its a life saver for me.','Works amazing A life saver','I have been on this birth control for 8 years and had no problems at all. It was great. I recently was put on a body acne medication that lowered the effectiveness of this brand so because of that reason I am switching to Zovia I hope it&039;s as good.','Overall, not too bad.  Had some mild nausea and diarrhea the first two or three days, but then drank Kefir which helped immensely.  Be sure to take as directed with some food (you don&039;t need a whole meal) and eat yogurt etc.  I highly recommend Kefir during Augmentin therapy.  Began clearing the infection by the second day.  Remember, most people have little to no side effects with these medications, so what you tend to read on the Internet is negatively biased.','I had to stop taken the medicine due to getting yellowing of the skin, fevers, nightmares, severe headaches, dizziness, hot flashes, restlessness, nausea, etc. The medicine was fine until about 3 days into it then I began to feel worse and it was even hard for me to breathe. I may be one of the select few who reacted this way and I followed everything that I was told to do exactly.','Love this medicine, works great with less side effects of regular Suboxone  Also with discount program I am saving $$$ very happy my Dr. told me about it.','End of Viibryd week 1 was starting to feel normal, then began week 2 at 20mg. More nausea (Ondancetron med really helps at work), no headaches this week. New symptom of gritty feeling in eyes--think it is dry eyes, so bought some good tear drops and seems a lot better now, will keep using. I switched over cold turkey from 40mg Lexapro. When starting any new antidepressant, I always take it on the weekend, NEVER during the workweek. It might make you sleep all day or be &quot;out of it,&quot; but that&039;s usually just an adjustment period you have to go thru. Too bad doctors don&039;t always let patients know what to expect.','I was on Celexa 20mg for a full year due to anxiety and panic attacks. The medicine was working great. I had to switch doctors and my new one suggested to a try Lexapro. She said its a cleaner and better medicine then Celexa. I said ok I&039;ll try it. It&039;s been two week and no side effects at all. It&039;s been great. I&039;m glad I switched. I&039;m taking 10mg of Lexapro now which is the same as 20mg Celexa.','I tried this pill after having been on so many others. I had been prescribed Femcon FE, Loestrin 24, Ortho Lo, YAZ, and Ocella. These pills caused me to have terrible stomach pains, go through nauseous periods all throughout the day, and have recurring dizziness. So, I finally decided to speak with my doctor about having me switch to Alesse. However, it wasn&039;t until I went to the pharmacy that I learned that Alesse is no longer available in the U.S. so I was given its generic Aviane.   Out of all of the birth controls I have tried, this one has been the most tolerable for me. I can eat normally without having to deal with recurring stomach upset after almost every meal. And, I don&039;t have to worry about dealing with crippling stomach pains.','I got skyla inserted 6 months ago and it&039;s been a nightmare since then. I&039;m 25 with no kids. My friend got Mirena when she was 21 and said it was amazing so I figured I&039;d try it. Insertion was pretty painful and i had cramps for a week. I went back and got an ultrasound to check the placement and was informed I had a irritated cyst and that it would go away..here I am 6 months later every 2 weeks I get insane cramping and a week long period. Before Skyla 3-4 day long periods and no cramps. I told myself if after 6 months im still in pain I&039;m getting it out. Obviously my body is not going to adjust and it&039;s not worth the pain I&039;ve also gained 20lbs in the first 4 months and noticed more zits, anxiety, and my hormones are crazy.','I&039;m 18 years old and have had all three of these shots. I don&039;t understand why people make this shot to be such a big deal. It barely hurt when I got them. Even if it did, who cares? If the shot is going to help you out in the long run. I never had any bad side effects I recommend it to any woman who likes to be proactive.','I started Avastin in November of 2009 after my spinal cord tumor started growing again. I was diagnosed with brain cancer in February 2009. The tumor is in my spinal cord, not in my brain. It effects my right leg. Makes it weak. I had surgery and went through radiation and chemo in April. The tumor was shrinking all summer and then started to grow again. In November 2009, I started Avastin as an addition to the existing Chemo called Temodar. As soon as I started Avastin, the tumor started to shrink, but my symptoms got way worse. So, I have a shrinking tumor, but side effects that are worse. ','I was put on half a mg for a week, then titrated to 1 mg. Everything was cool until about the 3rd or 4th wk I started feeling overhwelmed and ridiculously tired to where I couldn&039;t keep my eyes open. Then it progrogressed to full blown anxiety in my POV. I never thought it could be rexulti until I finally saw my doc who took me off straight away after seeing how anxious I was. I can hardly deal with my son or life. He sadly has to calm himself as noise and lots of energy around me exascerbate my anxiety. I&039;ve been completely off for a day but I&039;m wondering how long it will be before I&039;m not anxious. I hope not the 2-4 weeks my doc said. I can&039;t keep living with all this anxiety and tiredness and wanting to cry all the time.','I&039;m 34 and was prescribed this pill for irregular periods. I&039;ve only been on it for a week and I&039;d rather deal with bleeding for a month straight than the side effects that I&039;m already experiencing:  *extremely bloated  *had a couple of painful pimples pop up on my face and my chest  *have sore and swollen breasts  *increased appetite with 3 lbs. gained weight  *and the worst of all, have zero sex drive and am a psycho bitch to my husband who does not deserve to be treated like that    I&039;m throwing the rest of them straight in the garbage.','After many years of chronic bloating and constipation, I finally tried Linzess. I was taking Miralax daily, sometimes twice a day, for about a year but still no relief from the horrible bloating. I&039;d eat half an apple and have to move my belt buckle. Now, a little over a month on Linzess and I am no longer bloated, I go every day and feel SO much better No side effects at all. I just learned that taking with food can result in diarrhea or help if you feel constipated again. Will try that if I ever need it.','I feel like this medication is OK minus the weight gain feels like I put on a lot of weight and is hard to loose','I have been on this contraceptive for about 15 months. I haven&039;t experienced weight gain, but a weight loss of 3 pants sizes. Altough that&039;s great and everything, I&039;ve also been sick to my stomach at least once a week, and my period didn&039;t stop being extremely heavy. It also jumps around a lot more, and for a few months I didn&039;t have one. (Wasn&039;t pregnant, went to doctor and had to get put on medication to restart period) but all in all I think it&039;s decent.','My experience with this pill has been okay but my periods do last longer now for about 8 days and I also spot in between which is very annoying. I also take the pill at the same time everyday. I don&039;t think I&039;ll be staying on this pill for to much longer.','I have been taking Toprol XL for about 2 years. My doctor has now put me on 200mg twice a day, total 400mg a day, this had to be approve by my insurance company and it was. This is working for me, no side effects and my blood pressure is steady at 114/70.','The side effects were intolerable and it was not effective in minimizing bladder spasms with resulting leakage/incontinence.','As everyone else I have a terrible problem sweating and can only wear black t shirts or tank tops. I only started using this a year ago and aside from the burning and soreness after, its great. However, I just went to refill my prescription and was told that they are no longer manufacturing it, I went to many pharmacys and was told the same thing. I don&039;t understand why.','Honestly, I felt better about 4 hours after begging treatment with this for an infected/abcessed tooth.  Surprisingly quick, considering the amount of pain I was in.  The downside, for me at least, seems to be slight nausea/dizziness.  I had taken ibuprofen earlier due to pain, so this meant bad times in front of the toilet.  Be careful with other meds that may upset your stomach.','I followed the instructions correctly. It kind of worked at first but then it stopped, I was back to zero only with a overbloated belly and an unsettling feeling all day. Do not use','I get bad reaction to the adhesive. The redness stays for weeks and itches so bad. I clean the area with acetone to remove the adhesive residue and then clean it with alcohol. Hope you guys will create one for sensitive adhesive like sensitive bandage. The product helps with overactive bladder I just hope the itch and redness will go away. Been using this patch for a month.','My son was 6 when diagnosed.  Adderall finally came to our rescue.  Eventually it did not work long enough, so we give him a wake-up dose of 5mg IR, an 8am XR dose, then a 3pm IR dose to help with aftercare and homework.  This has continued to work for 3 years.  We tried Intuniv because his ODD and impulsivity was leading to threats of suspending him from school.  After 2 days we realized his BP was lower (too low), but he didn&039;t pass out.  After 2 weeks, his reacting to people was no longer on the calm side, he was emotional about everything, more impulsive and more defiant, not him at all.  We decided to take him off.  At least we can say that we tried, but it just did not work for my son, but it may for others.','This medicine is a godsend. I literally felt like it grew me up. it helps so much with bi polar disorder   I used to walk down the street and wonder what passing cars thought about me and wondered if they thought I walked silly. Weird but true. After a month on this medication my life changed. I was more focused my mood swings were not so sever if any at all (I used to have mood swings that would last four and sometimes six months at a time).   This medicine changed my life and I feel as though the effects were life changing Even when I stopped taking the medication I still felt the affects from how I felt. I do not recommend stopping taking the medication though as the mood swings will gradually find their way back into your life.   I','I started taking this medication as soon as I was diagnosed with an inherited seizure disorder. Although I haven&039;t had a seizure ever since I began to take the medication (which is good because the meds are working) the side effects were horrible. I would often feel very disoriented and saw a great amount of weight loss. This may not apply to everyone because everyone is different, but that was my experience with this medication.','I love this medicine. I do not sweat anymore. I don&039;t have the armpit stains. I can wear whatever I want without worrying about sweating. If you have excessive sweating you should try this product.','On my 3rd week with no improvement, increased pain, swelling, and FEVER exponentially increased, (not &quot;core&quot; temp just &quot;hot joints&quot;) decreased energy, frequent headache, and increased depression I didn&039;t know any of these things could get worse than they already were? But they have :-( Hanging in there because mine is in every single joint and &quot;unrelenting&quot; I don&039;t really have flares cuz mine is constant daily (and nightly) pain, swelling, the fever ','I have suffered severe pain for 20 years following a  motorcycle accident. During this time I have tried every sort of pain relief available to me, mainly narcotic drugs which I found as bad as the pain itself. Earlier this year I was prescribed Lyrica as far as pain relief goes...fantastic. After a few months (1x 75mg cap per day) I experienced total confusion and was unable to perform my daily tasks at work or at home. I was becoming agitated and experienced suicidal thoughts. Things returned to normal after a week or so of not taking Lyrica. Because it worked so well I am tempted to give it another go. It was just so good to not feel the pain anymore.','My son and wife both came down with bad cases of the flu, and I started to experience extreme chest tightness, cough, and fever about five days later. Took my first dose of Tamiflu about 15 hours after experiencing symptoms, and within 12 hours was feeling 50\% better. Within 24 hours was 90\% better. No side effects. Simply a miracle drug, and everyone should have a box in their medicine cabinet.','I took this on top of taking SAM-E for depression and fatigue. I&039;ll put the good first. This supplement is amazing. Makes me feel much more confident, much less socially anxious, and more able to be assertive, and have no fatigue. AND I am interested in things again. I feel joy from looking at the mountains and such. It started increasing my facial twitches from SAM-E which also Ritalin brought out. SJW feels kind of like a drug like Ritalin but with a much lower up. I&039;ve got to say I feel pretty good taking it. I take 350mg once in the morning, a double dose at 2:00, and a single dose again around 6:00. Sometimes I will take another dose around 10:00 p.m. I feel like I don&039;t need the SAM-E anymore. Highly recommend.','I am 19 years old and on my third pack (possibly fourth, I can&039;t remember for sure) of this birth control. The first two months were great I didn&039;t notice any side effects and my period was normal. This past month, though, I&039;ve started to notice a lot of nausea and some headaches. Most recently, my depression and anxiety have increased tenfold and gone through the roof. I can&039;t stop crying over everything and I&039;m a mess all the time. It&039;s time to stop this BC because it&039;s just making my life a living Hell.','I just switched to Rythmol from Toporal and am checking it out. My heart hasn&039;t done &quot;afib&quot; type things but I do have a horrible metalic taste that I wish would go away, outside of that it seems OK so far. Let me know your thoughts. I am a 51 year old male.','Very effective.','After my back surgery ( lumbar fusion ) I was given dilaudid, worked instantly in relieving pain, the only downside it does not last long,','Cleared up my abscess ..Also I kept getting bacterial vaginitis for a year straight. I swear my bacterial vaginitis cleared up This actually works to clear that up also. I thought my bacterial vaginitis issue was stuck with me forever.','It works very good for sleep as I have chronic insomnia due to severe anxiety, major depression. I didn&039;t take it yesterday and barely slept good. What I hate is the drowsy feeling it makes during day does it go away? This pill made my birthday a fine day I made a day outside feeling OK.','Background: Essential Tremor with Social Anxiety and IBS. I&039;m naturally VERY happy.  From 6mo Escitalopram 10mg to 1mo Viibryd 10mg.  Upped to 20mg Viibryd but two hours in, had panic attack tremors. Went back to 10mg for a 1mo more, until VERY HEAVY depression episodes at around 6 PM till 10 PM (took the pill at 8 AM) appeared. Also it gave me very bad diarrhea after eating most foods.  Can&039;t cold-turkey it (which I could with Escitalopram), would panic/shake/depression. Had to take the abuse till I switched back Escitalopram 10mg - which thankfully calmed me down from Viibryd withdrawal  I don&039;t feel this is the right drug for happy people with anxiety. It does more unnecessary anti-depressant changes than it does anxiety improvements.','I&039;ve been drinking since 12y/o.  Relapsed hard about 3 weeks ago after the manager at work had suspected that I had been drinking at work and fired me.  I spent all of the money I had left in the bank trying to drink myself to death.  Had a free ride to law school and lost that, so that played a big role in my depressive drinking.  Got to the hospital after I began going into withdrawals and they sedated me, and gave me a Librium prescription.  I&039;m a 210 pound male with 12\% bf so I&039;m a strong otherwise healthy guy.  Four 25 mg first day then tapered down the second day decreasing each day by 1 pill.  I&039;m still on 1 pill at night.  You should exercise when off to control CNS excitement.  Vivid dreams too. Saved me too.','I have been taking Ocella now for about 6 months and in those months I have experienced some weight loss as well as clearer skin. However I also have found that I have ABSOLUTELY NO sex drive. I am only 21 and before taking Ocella I had enough sex drive for me and other people, but now nothing.','I only took it for a week but it caused horrible headaches that were borderline migraines. They would start about 30-45 minutes after taking the pill and would not go away until I went to sleep. I was naseous and dizzy constantly and I would be very warm and hot. It was also causing heart burn which is something that I&039;ve never had before taking this pill. I also had zero interest in sex.','The product is working so well for my athletic pre-teen daughter. As she began to get very involved with sports, a lot of sweat and acne came. Now, using Duac, her acne has cleared and is under control. Her face isn&039;t so oily like before. She has a couple of blemishes, but nothing at all like before','as a supplement to levothyroxine it has been a night and day difference. I no longer sleep all the time and can think clearly. I actually want to do things now.','This worked great for my husband until he gave me his cold. I used this medicine and was somewhat relieved but had extremely uncomfortable gas and diarrhea. I thought I had a worse strain of virus and took the medicine again the next day. Within 45 min my stomach problems that had quit the night before returned with a vengeance. Dextromethorphan was the only ingredient I haven&039;t used before without this reaction. Unless it&039;s a new red dye allergy, I&039;m never taking anything with this ingredient again.','I have tried almost everything under the sun as related to acne medicine. The only thing that worked for me is Aczone. I have only been using it for 10 days now but my face has cleared up so fast. I have never seen my skin look so good in the last 5 years. It doesn&039;t irritate the skin and goes on very light and absorbs right in. Highly, highly recommended.','My thyroid test showed it to be under active, Dr increased Levothyroxine to 100 MCG to be taken two hours on empty stomach before I can eat  I guestioned Pharmacist and he confirmed  two hours wate.  Very difficult to wait 2 hours  I take several other medications  What can I do?','I used Voltaren gel on some sore joints (and a tennis elbow). It worked as well as anything I have ever tried. I sometimes get killer tension headaches that first build up in the back of the neck.  When I felt one coming on, I used the gel on the back of the neck and shoulders.  The headache never developed.  Before this experiment I would take 3 or 4 ibuprofen for one of these headaches and hope for the best.  The gel is now my standard treatment for these headaches.','I started Viibryd -- 20 mg/day -- over a year ago, when going thru a prolonged low. Like alot of folks, I&039;ve tried many different things in 20+ years, gone thru the rollercoaster of titrating on, titrating off, having stuff work then stop working, etc. To my surprise, Viibryd has helped -- though the diarrhea and so forth were super annoying at first (then gradually abated). Unlike most anti-depressants, I could feel an effect within first week or two, even titrating very gradually.    I recently went up to 40/mg. Mood brighter, helps clear up the brain fog. Various effects on body: deeper sleep, intense dreams, increased sex drive (almost annoying), as well as GI stuff. So far, so good','second day of being sick I was diagnosed (rapid test) with strep and put on this medication. After 5 days with worsening symptoms I started coughing up blood and was diagnosed with pneumonia. was taken off this and put on levofloxacin. 2 days later no more lung bleeding and the pneumonia is almost gone. would not recommend as it did nothing and allowed something I caught early to worsen as if I caught it too late.','I have been on paliperidone for about a year now. The side effects I have is I get alot of nightmares and bad dreams which I never had before. I do alot of rocking backwards and forwards every time I sit down which is really upsetting and annoying. I have alot of restlessness. I find it difficult to settle and do things. In terms of sleep, this medication is good. I have energy at least. I have tried other medications and had side effects as well. I am having this medication reduced and eventually will be off having antipsychotic drugs. I am sick of the side effects. Clozapine made me sick all the time and sleepy. Another medication I was on I had blurred vision. Sick of the side effects. I&039;d rather take the risk with having a relapse .','I got my Nexplanon inserted in the month of Janaury 2015, and it was very painful. I had my period for probably a month and spotting a little for 2 weeks. I don&039;t think I had any emotional changes, i was pretty much myself. But so far my Nexplanon has done wonders. I have not had a period or any spotting until today.','I&039;ve had back pain for almost 3 years now, sometimes to the point of tears due to simple actions like walking or bending. After being put on this medication 3-4 doses daily, I have had the pain relieved, and my actual mood and focus has increased at work. My previous evaluations and reviews were below average and now after being put on this treatment my last two reviews have increased to above average. It takes effect quite quickly and lasts for the directed amount of time on the prescription. The only con I have for this medication is that it affects myself in a negative way during intercourse. I have found when on the medication my climax takes 3-4 times as long or not at all during that time. Quite frustrating.','Had severe diarrhea, admitted in hospital. They gave me Flagyl,and it stopped the diarrhea. Then at home 4 years later had severe diarrhea and used 500mg of Flagyl 3 times a day,and was well. Thank the Lord for Flagyl.','I had this in hospital when I broke my arm. It worked awesome. The only negative was the constipation, unable to relieve myself for 4-5 days after.','Started smoking at 13, up to 2 1/2 pack a day. Wife also smoked, up to 2 packs a day.  We both started Zyban at the same time.  Took meds and smoked for a week, stopped the smoking, then a week later, stopped the meds.  Haven&039;t regretted doing it.  Although I don&039;t feel a whole lot better, still huff and puff at the top of the stairs, gained about 25 pounds, but I know we are both better for having quit.  Recommend to anyone who really wants to quit.','After being diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder, my doctor prescribed me Lexapro. I was very skeptical.  I finally took it after having a few days with me debating whether or not to take it. It made me feel a lot better. I&039;m only a few days into it but I can feel a difference. I&039;m a little dizzy and find myself yawning when I first take my dose of 10mg, but that usually goes away. I also had to use the restroom several times, but overall not a lot of side effects. I&039;m surprised and pleased so far and I&039;m sure I&039;ll have to up my dose in a few months.','WEIGHT LOSS GREAT but hair loss is not worth it','Zantac worked wonders on me. I have taken this medicine for 3 almost 4 years now I used to not be able to eat. After I started this medicine I was able to eat a lot more. This worked wonders on me. The other day I took a Prevacid and it didn&039;t help at all. Also this didn&039;t work on me at first until my doctor put me on this 2X daily.','Works great. I feel like myself again- positive, energetic, interest in activities has returned.','I I could not take it stomach problems and barfing  I am very allergist to sulfa penicillin bioxen do not know if that had something to do with it','I got the Implanon 3 years ago and have had no side effects from it. Got it taken out today and had the Nexplanon put in the same spot. I am a bit sore from it but it was a much easier procedure then I thought it would be','Suprep was absolutely wonderful I added ginger ale with the solution and water. After taking the first dose at 6:00pm used the restroom for 1-1/2hrs, was able to sleep without interuptions. Second dose at 4:00am was also great, was able to sleep  1-1/2 hrs also. The Colonoscoby was a great procedure. I oped out on the anesthesiologist, I felt no need to pay two MD&039;s.  I had Versed and Fentanyl in the Ivy, it worked great. I was anxious and nervous,  I wanted to reschedule the procedure do to my anxiety. But I didn&039;t, if I can do it so can you. Good luck God Bless.','I had tried Zoloft in the past, went off because I was feeling better. Many years later, needed something again. Went back on Zoloft - it did nothing. Tried it in combo with Wellbutrin - nothing. Tried just the wellbutrin - nothing... except a 25 pound weight gain. Everyone says you lose weight on Wellbutrin... uh.. not so much I gained 25 lbs in spite of barely eating and taking up running...AND.. it made me sweat ALL THE TIME. It did nothing for my mood, but the side effects were completely depressing. P.S. the weight did NOT come off after I quit taking it. My guess is it damaged my already slow metabolism.','Helps me keep my attention in class,  but seems to make me keep grinding my teeth and move my jaw around.  A tick I guess.','I was prescribed Bactrim for a bacterial skin infection under my arm. I get infections easily and am often on all kinds of antibiotics. Many bother me, but I have not had any problems at all while on Bactrim. And the skin infection has been clearing up very well (I&039;m almost done with the medication.) I&039;m very happy with this medication.','I&039;m so glad I got Paragard. But at the beginning I almost took it out/  INSERTION: Not going to lie, it really hurt for me. It felt like some of the worst cramps I&039;d ever experienced. I didn&039;t take painkillers afterwards and the 40 minute bus ride home it felt like it was pulling apart my body. TAKE A GOOD DOSE OF ADVIL/IBUPROFEN.   Afterwards: Horrible cramps, felt pretty sick for 5 days. My vagina felt like it&039;d lost feeling. I tried to test it, and an orgasm really hurt. I thought something had gone wrong, After a week, things returned to normal, and sex felt good again.   First two periods: They were the literal worst I&039;ve had in my life. I was totally out of work.  Periods since: I DON&039;T HAVE CRAMPS ANYMORE It&039;s so amazing. Period. Worth it.','Ruconest works perfect for me I can self-administer and it works much quicker than Berinert and Firazyr. Also no issues with side effects so far. Thank you so much Ruconest (And also my insurance ).','Been on this for roughly 3 weeks. I started taking 10 mgs but I&039;m currently only taking 2.5 mgs. The first week was a lil bad. I took at night and the med kicked in in like 3 hours. I couldn&039;t sleep, had increased anxiety and it upset my stomach. I cut down to 5 then 2.5. Now I&039;m fine,  panic attacks are pretty much gone (before I was getting them daily sometimes even 2 or 3 times). The attacks were starting to interfere with work n life n I had to get some help. I tried working out n eating better but it wasn&039;t helping. This works but it takes time. Also, I take this in the mornings with food. It gives me energy so taking at night wasn&039;t good for me bc it would keep me up. Start with a low dose so your body gets used to it.','This product really helps when it comes to congestion, runny nose, etc. Definitely recommend it for cold symptoms.','I have situational depression, never dealt with it before. Wellbutrin had definitely helped get me out of bed each day. The &quot;situation&quot; is becoming better as well but I find my emotions aren&039;t as out of whack. I cry less &amp; get angry less. I do feel it made me more anxious which I&039;m already dealing with &amp; taking Buspirone for. I didn&039;t experience many side effects BUT one that is hard to deal with but because it seems to make me get through each day a little better, I deal with it. It makes my throat feel closed, which is very annoying. I feel often like I can&039;t breathe well &amp; that I can&039;t swallow or that something is stuck in my throat. I&039;ve not taken any other pills on several days to determine that it was the Wellbutrin that did it &amp; it is.','Etodolac did a great job on my knee pain.  Unfortunately possibly due to my Crohn&039;s disease also caused extreme diarrhea and gas.  I had to discontinue use.','I have been on Depo for almost two years and it works like a charm I never go past the 5 day period to get the shot and it is crucial for it to work to not exceed the time of your next shot. When I first started I did bleed for a month but it was not heavy. My periods lasted 8 days and cramps were horrible before the shot so it wasn&039;t that big of a deal for me. Now I don&039;t get periods ever and ever so often i might spot for a day or two. To be completely frank my partner and I do not use protection and I have not gotten pregnant so as far as contraceptives go this one is wonderful I did experience dryness at first but it has since gone away.','I have been on this BC for around three years now.   Going on Generess FE was an amazing decision, though adjustment was tough at first. I&039;m actually on the generic version now since they released it, but my benefits are still there. I previously would have insane mood swings in the week leading up to my period--I&039;m talking sporadic crying and feelings of anxiety. This went away when I started this medicine. My period lasts barely more than one or two days and I don&039;t need to buy more than the &quot;lite&quot; tampons. Periods now are completely painless and barely more than a slight inconvenience. My skin is clearer than ever, and this has worked wonders for me. I&039;m not pregnant, and I&039;ve reaped all the benefits of this medicine','Horrible drug. Paxil is garbage. I&039;ve been on the majority of these psych drugs. Pure poison. Now that the horrible withdrawal effects are lessening--I&039;m getting much better. While on and coming off them, it was pure hell.  That&039;s my experience.','Tried Effexor, Wellbutrin, Paxil, Zoloft in the past with no results.  EMSAM has brought me out of it after seven years.  Only a little localized skin irritation.','I found that this medication made a HUGE difference within even the first day of taking it, however, the nasty bitter taste was really hard to get by &amp; I even threw up once when i was trying to take it, BUT I discovered taking the pill with milk masks the nasty taste, I now put the pill on the back of my tongue and swallow it down with water. Try it, I guarentee it will help','All depends on the individual I actually found that Keppra made my seizures WORSE. I started taking Keppra and was fine for 2 years with no side affects, no seizures, nothing, then 1 day I had a massive grand Mal seizure the doctors keep upping my dose. Now I am on the maximum dose but still having seizures. Before I took Keppra I had only a few fits in my life now I have them about once every couple of weeks.','Started Cipralex 10mg 7 months ago. First few weeks side effects were not enjoyable, but I stuck with it. Within a month not only was I noticing feeling better, but friends and family were also noticing I had a better overall mood. Last few weeks, I have had my DR up my does to 20mg a day, due to starting to feel the same horrible mood I did before starting. See to have build a small tolerance. In terms of anxiety, this medication has 0 effect in helping me.','I have experienced mild to moderate headaches relatively everyday, dry mouth, bad taste in my mouth after I have taken it, severe leg cramps and a loss of 28lbs in 3 months.  To off set the headaches and cramps I have increased my H2O intake to equal 1/2 of my body weight in oz.  Yes, it is a struggle to drink that much however the long term benefits out weigh the temporary issues.','I felt a difference right away. The only negative feedback I have is the tiredness. I can&039;t stay awake but I do not know if it is from coming off of ADD medication. I have been on this medication for 3 days now and already feel like a new woman I no longer need my Xanax','My son ADHD sensory processing and now since putting him on strattera 10 mg diagnosed aspergers is off and on with strattera . I see improvement but after a few weeks psychiatrist out him on respirodone half of .25 . However , not sure what is working anymore .','Used on cracked hill on my feet.  Applied 3 times a day for two weeks.  Wonderful.  My feet are like a baby skin.','It definitely makes you go but omg the nausea is awful. I didn&039;t throw up but I couldn&039;t even talk or move in bed because I had to concentrate so hard not to throw u . The stomach pain is really awful. Comparison is to like the stomach flu. I&039;ve been taking laxatives for years and never have I felt this before. Especially after reading all these reviews I know I&039;m not the only one. Too intense. Like....damn I wanted a BM but not to get the flu with it geez','I had been medication free for over 10 years when a series of traumatic events escalated in full blown psychosis and deep depression. I was suicidal, unable to sleep and experiencing 6 hour long panic attacks. I was put on olanzapine 5mg at night and have been taking it for just over 1 year. I was able to sleep through and the nightmarish world I inhabited slowly began to clear like a thick fog. At the time I thought there was no way I would make it out alive The deep depression took longer to lift and after no luck combining it with proxac or citalopram I hit on the right combination with Effexor 225mg. Still, the Olanzapine was my &039;daylight&039; drug. Weight gain has been an issue but my appetite is more manageable now and am exercising.','I like this medicine when I am on a trip and it does work fast but it&039;s expensive.','This drug is saving my life right now. Its a shame the people who abuse it ruin it for those of us who get relief from debilitating issues from it, because many doctors just don&039;t want to prescribe it now. I say what&039;s the point of having a drug if you can&039;t use it to help people who need it.','Sitting here shaking in my boots this stuff is weak 1mg 3 times a day','All it did was make me feel like a zombie. I personally don&039;t recommend this drug, as it only makes you get nauseous and very tired, and causes insomnia.','This is a drug that takes a long time to get fully into your system.  It does not just &quot;work&quot; after a day or a week.  I was on this medication from 2004 to 2007.  It worked pretty well (about 85\%) for anxiety, but not very well for depression.  My nutritionist and Doctor agreed that it was the medication that caused me to gain 30 pounds (which by the way, does not help depression.) I had to keep a food journal and keep track of my activity level. The overall panic subsided, but at night when trying to fall asleep I would occasionally have chest pain, or rapid heartbeat, or trouble breathing.  You just have to try to find ways around medicines to cope.  ','I have taken Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, and then my Doctor Put me on WellButrin XL 150 in the morning and that was helping me but not in the evening so she increased the Wellbutrin XL to 300mg in the morning and 150 in the evening and that was working, my mood seem to be great But then I learned since I take the 300 and 150 that there was a new formulation on the market called Forfivo XL 450 and I take that once a day in the morning along with some Lamictal 100mg and I feel GREAT. I don&039;t have the worrying I had at work with coworkers, or the mood swings I had while I was at work or being with family. I still take Klonopin 1mg three times a day for my anxiety and panic attacks and I take Klonopin 1mg at bedtime and Elavil 50mg to help me sleep.','Finished treatment almost a week ago. Undetectable virus load two weeks into treatment. Virus remains undetectable  Odd mild headache which lasted a couple of minutes, but took no medication whatsoever avoiding possible interaction. I&039;ve had no other side effects. I continue working and living my normal life. I eat plenty vegetables; smoothie made of fresh bananas, blackberries, blueberries, mango and kiwis. I kept the weight at bay and drink fresh beetroot with green apple. No alcohol or fried foods &amp; drunk lukewarm water mixed with fresh lemon juice &amp; swallow raw garlic with an empty stomach. Contaminated illness during my childhood. Don&039;t despair. Treatment works &amp; it&039;s bearable. Best to you all.','After giving birth, lay up in a hospital bed and taking all kinds of medicines. Milk of Magnesia is the best way to get the well needed relief. For me, it doesn&039;t cause any of that rumbling you get with laxatives. Thanks.','I switched from Risperidal to Abilify two years ago.  On 15mg and it works much better for me. On Risperidal my symptoms (paranoia) still poked through, but not anymore.  Also the side effects are a lot less present.  I still sleep about 10 hours though. Otherwise my functioning is high.','I had Skyla put in Feb 2015. I am 31, no kiddos, I went to work immediately after getting Skyla put in. I took 2 Aleve and the pain/severe cramps were gone. I had my first period for 17 days straight. One week no period. Then 2 more weeks of period. Eventually getting lighter and lighter but still the full 7 days. Side effects are acne, gained 15lbs, moody and no cramping. I have tried everything to work off the added pounds but nothing is working despite eating healthy and working out 5 days a week. Not sure if I will be keeping it in the full 3 years, the side effects are just not fun.','Use to take occasional aids natural herbs and such when needed which was from months to days depending on stress and issues at the time. This has been all my adult life. Eventually I can get it under control.  Fast forward to this past year. Got severely sick with some stomach parasites, lots about 20\% weight and did not sleep but maybe half hour a day and an occasional 5-10 minute nap for several months, basically for 2 weeks straight I was fortunate if I could get 30 minutes. May natural stuff was not working. So my friend let me try his for the last few months - works. Took a few days to get use to. 25 mg works for me, with 12mg I get 3 hours, with 37.5mg about 14-18 hours. STRESS is the key, lower it is the better it works.','I got this shot about 2 and a half months ago. I have not stopped bleeding/ spotting from the first day i got it, not even for a day. Im a surgeon&039;s first nurse, so im on my feet all day, and every now and again i get cramps along with it. My Dr did tell me that the irregularities would be stopping after another dose or 2, which mean i would have to wait about 3- 6 months to some see dry panties. NO.','You owe it yourself to give this medication a chance. Been dealing with insomnia for 10 yrs. Then last year my little brother killed two people and committed suicide. My anxiety, depression, insomnia went into overdrive. No meds worked. Was prescribed 50 mg of generic Seroquel. If you&039;ve had insomnia for years, nothing is going to work the first night. You&039;re worked up about the insomnia and so desperate for the pill to work that of course it&039;s going to be a night from hell. That led to a rocky 2nd night. Night 3 I slept great It takes 2 1/2 hrs for onset. I owe my life to this medication. If you have the kind of insomnia that is near psychosis please give this medication a real chance. You do not have to suffer anymore. Sweet dreams.','It makes the pain bearable. Little side effects and easy to use since it is changed only once weekly. It makes my fibromyalgia manageable.','I have been on Loestrin 24 for about 6 months now and am quite satisfied  In the beginning, I did experience some nausea for about the first month but once I got over that hurdle everything has gone well.  NO bloating, NO nausea, NO mood swings, and MOST IMPORTANTLY A VERY SHORT CYCLE My cycle has always been irregular; having about one a year. So with me getting older my doctor said it would be best for my health to try and regulate my cycle.  Well it worked  If I must have a cycle each month (after not having to for the past 20 yrs) its nice to have one only for a few days and without any PMS symptoms','I had 40+ injections of 200 units of Botox for migraine approximately two and a half weeks ago. The first few days were horrible, as they made my migraines worse. Now my migraines have reduced (which is awesome), but I have horrible pain in my arms and hands that I&039;ve never experienced before. My forearm muscles won&039;t flex, so somehow the toxin spread rather far away. My mouth is extremely dry as well and I have difficulty swallowing. The pain in my arms is unbearable at times. I do not recommend Botox at all, despite the reduction in migraines. I will never get this again. Also my face looks completely foreign to me and I&039;m embarrassed to be in public or make eye contact with anyone.','Amazing topical relief. I 100\% recommend it.','My hubby has been using this for years and has always said it works.  I AGREE 100\%.  We are having difficulty finding it in the pharmacy stores, it seems that they are not carrying it anymore. ','I&039;ve suffered for years with allergies both seasonal/environmental and chemical. I carried Benadryl and hydrocortisone in my purse for years.  I recently had issues with my ight hear with vibration and popping as well as hearing my inhalation through my nose in my ear.  I also had awful post nasal drip year round for as long as I could remember. I went to an ENT doc and he prescribed me Astelin.  I take one spray in each nostril in the morning and again at bedtime.  I&039;ve been on it for about a month now and I have never felt better.  The hives have decreased, my swollen hands have gone down and my ear is like new I highly recommend this antihistamine nasal spray.

It was as painful if not more painful as shingles. Have been taking Zyvox for 14 days with 3 to go. It has worked to heal the sores. The problem is the constant stomach upset and nausea.

Somewhat like sea sickness.','I took citalapram for nine weeks unsuccessfully and mirtazapine for 8months, too many side effects, numb emotional feelings and made anxiety worse , feeling aggressive, aching joints,big changes in weight and bodily functions , not easy to withdraw from either, worsening thoughts, (don&039;t think relapse, think it&039;s the drug) or you&039;ll end up back on it. My opinion is never again, beware','The Actavis generic version of this medication was worse than useless, as all of the ADHD hyperactive subtype symptoms my son was experiencing returned within a week of switching to this from the Intuniv ER brand (daily 2mg dose), along with new and potentially dangerous side-effects.  His symptoms had been well-controlled for years prior to the insurance company insisting that we try a generic before they would continue to cover the cost of the brand.','I am a teen who suffered from borderline mild-severe acne. My dermatologist prescribed Epiduo. Nothing over the 6 weeks. She then put me on Doryx with it. I fell in love with my skin after about a week. It dried up current problem spots and never got a breakout. However, do NOT take in calcium while on this. The medicine will bind to the calcium and will not take effect. Whenever I eat a good amount of cheese, milk, or dairy, I break out. You should experiment with your diet if this medicine does not work for you.','42 year old female.  1 month ago I got went to urgent care for UTI.  I was given Cipro.  The burning never went away.  I finished all the antibiotics and say by Gyn.  Had another urine test along with a Pap.  All were normal.     This entire week I felt bad.  Extremely tired, shakey, weak, irritable and of course the burning that never stopped.  Went to urgent care tonight.    I saw a young male physicians assistant.   He suggested a rocephin shot.  It hurt like heck but 3 hours after the shot, it&039;s like I&039;m healed instantly.   My whole body feels 100\%better.  I think the burning is finally gone.  I hope I feel this great tomorrow.  It&039;s been one miserable month.','I got Kyleena inserted yesterday and it was painful. I haven&039;t had a period in two years (I was on Depo Provera), so I haven&039;t experienced and cramping in a long time. I took 800 mg of ibuprofen an hour before and I do believe that it helped with the pain. All day I cramped terribly like I&039;ve never felt before, so bad I was continuously puking. I also had terrible diarrhea for some reason. Today (one day later) the cramps are very small and infrequent. I still can barely eat without feeling nauseated and have diarrhea, but I assume it will continue getting better. I barely bled at all and overall I feel like it&039;s worth it','This is an exceptional medicine. I have been on it for only a couple of weeks. I have tried Seroquel, trazodone, Ambien and none of these have worked but alprazolam is a miracle medicine.','This is my 3rd month on doxycycline and my face have shown great improvements I&039;m 19 with oily skin and before I had moderately severe acne with cysts, papules and pustules.  At one point it hurt and annoyed me so much plus lowered my self esteem that I decided to meet a dermatologist . She prescribed 100mg of doxycycline along with 5\% benzoyl peroxide to be taken daily . During the first month, it was horrible. My face broke out terribly but I guess that was a part of it, clearing out the disgusting stuff inside our face . In the second month my skin start to clear up, and now I can say that I&039;m 95\% acne free with occasional small zits during period but nothing hurt as much as before. The point is, don&039;t give up :)','This product is amazing. Cleared up fungus that I&039;ve had for over 30 years in less than a year.','If you can imagine restlessness and extreme sleepiness at the same time, horrible. Walking around in my apartment shaking my arms and legs while being so sleepy and tired was miserable but I have since read that if you are taking medication for seratonin uptake inhibitors that it could cause that so I think it was a side effect. Still ......miserable , so make sure what you are taking with it and discuss with your doctor concerns about drug interactions.','I was diagnosed with AFIB in 2012 at the age of 43, long sad frustrating story cut short, the doctor said there was nothing he could do about it. He sent me home to suffer with it. A couple of weeks ago I made an appt. with the clinic and the most wonderful nurse practioner started me on Metoprolol 25 mg/2x daily and &quot;I FEEL GREAT&quot; I couldn&039;t believe how my heart calmed down, my anxiety was relieved, I SLEPT BETTER b/c it stopped the night time AFIB attacks which constantly woke me up in the middle of the night and i just feel much more comfortable in my own skin...I actually cleaned the house without any huffing, puffing or the usual AFIB attack. I agree that it makes me drowsy which is becoming less severe I LOVE IT :)','I have dosed at 20mg and 10mg and I&039;ve found that 10mg works best for me. I started taking cit after getting divorced to deal with anxiety (I have PTSD and my ex exacerbated this with stalking). If I take it on an empty stomach it can give me nausea but a banana or something simple fixes this. It will give me a mild headache about an hour after taking but that doesn&039;t last long. I do not take any other meds or herbs. I am a white female over 50. On 20 mg I felt so &quot;relaxed&quot; I tended to spend money I shouldn&039;t. I dosed down to keep that in check. It helps me manage single parenting stress and reduces angry reactions in stressful situations. Other than the light headaches and mild temporary nausea, no other side effects.','Getting better results than with Lantus.  Used Lantus for 7 years.  I have used Toujeo for 1 year as of April 2016.  Did not experience any adverse side effects.  Blood sugar much more stable - not as many highs or lows.  Makes it easier to do fine-tuning with my mealtime insulin.  A1c came down and stayed between 6 and 6.3.','I have been on this medicine for two weeks now. I have read a bunch of those comments and they all helped me. Thanks. I put them all together and here is mine. Honestly, IT&039;S NOT WORKING  I take with food, I have nausea, I get tired, (the first day, I was so sleepy), dizzy, afternoon hunger, still crave for carbs in the middle of the day, headaches, stomach pain, and now that I take one at night too,  I understand,  after reading some comments, why I have being having weird dreams. I have an appointment with my doctor coming March because she told me CONTRAVE can increase my blood pressure and she wants to monitor very close.  I also feel bad about the price, Not worth','Ive been taking Dexilant for 3 months. Now I have diarrhea. Besides that this is my miracle pill.','During the ten days on Provera I was emotional, my boobs hurt severely, my face broke out like crazy, and I had horrible fatigue. Two days after the 10 days of taking Provera, I have the worst period I have ever had in my entire life. Having to change my pad/ tampon every single hour was disgusting, I couldn&039;t even enjoy a shower because even afterward I still bled non stop. Each day that passes, the heavier my period gets. Today is my 6th day, and 4,5,&amp;6 where heavy as hell, but 5&amp;6 had excruciating cramps. And too many blood clots :( I do not recommend this pill at all.','I started taking this because my previous birth control was on backorder at every pharmacy. I&039;ve had acne for about 5 yrs &amp; I&039;ve tried everything but accutane, but to no avail. I accepted that I was going to have to deal with acne.  I&039;m entering my third month on Junel now and have noticed a drastic difference in my skin. I was a little bummed by Junel at first because I was having regular spotting (I&039;m a period skipper), but now that I&039;ve seen this change in my skin I think I&039;ll deal with the spotting. It was an accidental benefit, but I&039;m very happy with it. Can&039;t attest to the effectiveness of pregnancy prevention bc I always use condoms.','I&039;ve been on Pristiq for 18 months 100mg. It took 4 to 5 weeks to help me have a relaxed outlook on life. I still have a lot of the side effects you are all talking about.

Due to a pharmacist error of my Cytomel I&039;m now disabled for life due to thyrotoxicosis. My reg dosage 15mcgs daily,and for 3 months. I was given 150 mcgs daily. I also was taking 75mcgs T4 daily. I assumed I was dying and started to get my affairs in order. On the 4th refill the pharmacist caught his mistake and called my Dr. Because to this day there&039;s been no data of any person having an overdose of T3 Cytomel for at least 3 months my Dr&039;s have done there best.   The American Thyroid Org. has no data on it either. I and many others have looked worldwide.

Now i&039;m 20mg Lexapro, 1mg Rexulti and .5mg Clonopin.   I&039;m noticing good changes.  To balance the weight and restlessness, I decided to get up early and do a quick workout and i substituted any junk food for apples, oranges, bananas, raw carrots for protein- roasted chicken, cottage cheese, bagels.....you can add what you like    i do have some vivid dreams, restless, head aches, blurry vision and numbness/tingling in right arm. DOC says it should go away','Takes pain away instantly. Amazing medicine','I had recurring boils in one area. They would show up randomly so the dr. was never able to take a culture since they would come to a head and then pop whenever. He put me on a 20 day regimen of Keflex (500) and another ointment antibiotic that he told me to dab into my nose. He said for some odd reason, boils seem to start in the nose. I followed the instructions and had a minor recurrence several months later. I went immediately to see him so he put me back on Keflex. These boils were clustered and leaving scars in the area. They haven&039;t recurred and the scars are gone. Since I caught them starting the 2nd time, they never had a chance to come to a head because I stayed on top of it. I highly recommend it for a skin bacterial infection.','I have been on this medication for over 9 years and it works great for me. My periods are way lighter and the pain is much more manageable. It causes no mood swings or weight gain for me. Overall, works great and is very affordable; my insurance covers all of it, but even without insurance it&039;s only $9/month.','After 8 weeks virus free  No discomforts.Typ 1','I just wanted to say as someone who suffered immensely because of this drug, the reviews here regarding other people&039;s experiences has been a great comfort to me as I now know I am not alone nor am I crazy for having felt it. The sheer, true panic this drug caused me is completely indescribable.     Before taking Reglan I had no problem with doctors, hospitals, or even needles. I went to the hospital a couple months ago for a very severe migraine and they gave me Reglan for nausea. Within moments of having taken it, I experienced the most insane panic attack of my life. I don&039;t even know if you can describe it as simply a &quot;panic attack&quot; because it was so much more and so much worse than that. I nearly ripped the IV out of my arm.','I was hooked on opiates for 10 years Mostly snorting oxy and perks for the first 7 to 8 years and the last 2 years I was introduced to morphine H and hydromorphone as well as the needle. Although I was a mess all these years it wasn&039;t until I tried the needle that opened my eyes to my addiction. I went downhill fast.  I tried everything but there was no stopping this. I tried cold turkey to quit a few times and almost went crazy and died from sickness. The sickness I started to feel from the needle was way worse than it ever was sniffing. I knew I had to get off but I tried methadone before and it didn&039;t help me it made me feel the exact opposite of how suboxone makes me feel. Subs=energy,happy,stable,no urges, not stoned','I was in a bad car accident 3 years ago and it tore up my already injured back. At first I relied on Cymbalta and narcotics to get through the pain. The narcotics lifted my mood and the Cymbalta did help with all other pain. Eventually the narcotic I was on (lortab) stopped working all together. I&039;m not a big fan of opiates for pain relief and would not have taken them had it not been my only choice to feel normal. (I couldnt even sit in my car for more than 15 mins without searing nerve pain).I accidently stumbled on a review that said Wellbutrin also helped with back pain. It has been the best thing that&039;s happened to me. It has replaced both meds and I feel great Cymbalta was horrible to come off of, Lortab not so much but think I was just lucky.','This medication helped my symptoms tremendously. The main issue I had (and had to stop taking the medication) was low platelet count. Please if you are on this medication have your platelets checked routinely. My therapist  never told me this could be a side effect... I finally went to my family physician because I was bruising so badly.','I&039;m 17 years old and I have Suttons Disease 2 and my doctor told me to take Nucynta 4 times a day. Well I can only take it once a day because it is very strong. It did relieve my pain but I&039;m having VERY bad anxiety and I can&039;t sit still or concentrate at school or work, but I am pain free.',Great,'I started Saxenda in June 2017. I&039;ve lost 40 lbs. Since I started. I also combined it with the Ketogenic diet. The first month I felt nauseous and no appetite. It made me dizzy not eating. So, I forced myself to eat high fat low carb foods and man it helped. It&039;s amazing what an avocado a day can do for you. I am now trying to incorporate a regular (portion controlled) diet into my life. It&039;s a lot harder than you think after limiting carbs for a few months. I have about 30 more lbs to lose before my goal weight. I started at 5&039;6 213lbs. Size 14. I weigh 175 now and a size 10. I&039;m at that point were I&039;m fearful it&039;s going to stop working - I hope not but we will see.

It worked wonders my first round of it 4 pills 2 days. I got it again a year later and this time ...side effects kicked in big time. My fingers were sore, severe muscle aches, red inflamed spots on my chest, fever and headaches. It lasted 1 whole day but the bacterial vaginitis was gone and haven&039;t had it since but it gave me a yeast infection.','After taking buproprion hcl XL 150mg a day I felt some relief from depression, anxiety and adhd. My MD thought I should see a psychiatrist and would not increase my dosage. I went online and found that the proper dosage for me should be 300 mg a day.  As a duplicate bridge player my performance went from last to an astounding first place finish yesterday. Listen to your doctor but do your own research.','I quit abusing medicines and drinking 2 1/2 years ago, but never thought I would quit smoking. I started taking Chantix January 17, and have been cigarette free since January 24 The freedom from not smoking feels amazing I&039;ve had some crazy dreams, but I have weird dreams anyway. Thank you Chantix for helping me kick the habit','I had been on Lexapro for over a year and it was working great with the exception of having zero libido. With my relationship at stake I decided to try Pristiq. After about a week I realized that I was back to my old irritable, pre-medicated self. I have been crying at the drop of a hat, snapping on loved ones, and I have been nauseous almost everyday. Not to mention I went from 125 pounds to 137 pounds in a month. I talked to my doctor today and she suggested trying Viibryd.','I&039;m going into my 3rd day and I feel at least the same if not worse.  I am burning up and my cough is deeper...I&039;ve coughed up a little blood.  I wonder if I was misdiagnosed. I don&039;t know whether to wait it out or go to the ER...I feel horrible.','Taking this pill was an awful experience. Everything was going fine until right around the time that I started the second month of it- and since then, I have had nasty breakthrough bleeding ever since then (Not to mention the breast soreness, leg cramps, and depression). I&039;m finishing the pill this week and it hasn&039;t gotten any better or worse. So basically I&039;ve had my period for 8 weeks straight. ','I was hopeful after reading all the reviews, but I was on 50mg for 2 days and could not bring myself to take it the third day. I was incapable of looking after my two young children, I was out of it and didn&039;t even feel I could get in the car and drive, the simple task of cooking dinner seemed like a nightmare to me. Would have been interesting to see how long this lasted and see the wonderful effects I am reading about. Maybe when my husband is on holidays I might try again but being Christmas in 3 days, working and looking after kids I need to be clear headed. On the plus side I couldn&039;t hardly eat and lost 2kgs.','I started Contrave Monday, just five days into it now, it&039;s Friday night and I&039;ve lost somewhere about 7 lbs already.

I&039;m on low carb diet (Atkins) - and am deep into ketosis, no carb cravings, and eating about 2,500 calories a day LOL    Side effects have been a bit bothersome, jittery at times, and this sort of &quot;motion sickness&quot; feeling. Appetite is GONE.','Given for back pain due to ruptured disc it works fairly well. Thanks','Metrogel is a very good solution to curing a vaginal infection. A common side effect not listed is heavy discharge. I have also experienced pelvic cramping from day 3-7 but about the same as menstrual cramps.','I had been prescribed Klonopin in the past to treat severe anxiety until my appointment with a psychiatrist who deemed that such an approach to my anxiety issues was heavy handed. He took me off of them and since then I&039;ve been on Lexapro, Buspar, Seroquel, Zoloft, Pristiq, Paxil, Atarax all to little or no avail. I moved to a different area and got a new Psychiatrist who diagnosed me with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The original course of treatment for that was Ativan 0.5mg three times daily. I was switched to Xanax 1mg twice a day as needed. A couple of months passed by without substantial improvement and I was bumped to Xanax 1mg 3x day Doctor decided Klonopin would be a better approach earlier today. So far so good.','This stuff straight up works. I&039;m a 27 year old who has performance anxiety issues, and this stuff is a life saver. Don&039;t listen to those who say it doesn&039;t help with psychological issues; it really does My only two complaints are the cost, and ironically, sometimes it&039;s TOO easy to get an erection (it doesn&039;t take too much stimulation and it&039;s rock hard).','I had the first afib experience in 2004 (age 63)while playing senior softball, took shock paddles to convert.  Kept playing sports and had second episode in 2007, converted with Amiodarone. Stayed on that until new doctor (insurance changed), took me off without a replacement, re-ocurrence couple months later, restarted on Amiodarone for conversion.   Back with original doctor, kept up Amiodarone and all the blood work, x-rays, pulmonary  function tests, etc. required semi-annual till 2014. Finally (after more tests) was switched   to  100 mg. Flecanide &amp; 12.5 mg. Metoprolol  twice daily, with no semi-annual tests.  So far-so good, except for some arthritis ? issues, still active in sports (senior). Hopefully  this will stay with me.','Use for Chronic pain. This is 4 Spinal Surgeries History.

I&039;ve gained noticeable weight, solely because I feel like I cant stop eating. Even more so, I&039;m exhausted all the time, my energy is low. I&039;m a very active person and its becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with the work outs. This is NOT me. I&039;ve also had headaches (and migraines) almost everyday. These headaches are debilitating. I&039;ve had to call out of work because my head was pounding and I was overwhelmed with nausea.   I&039;m currently working with my OB to find an alternative. I&039;m sure this pill would be great for someone, but its not the one for me.','I was prescribed to take this twice a day for 7 days for bacterial vaginosis. I will never allow a doctor to prescribe me this ever again The taste comes from nightmares for starters, and good LORD the side effects are NOT worth it Constant nausea, dizziness, everything tastes like fecal matter, fevers, restlessness, overall weak and uncomfortable. This cannot be good for you. I didn&039;t even have any side effects with the BV itself, It&039;s this medication that has been making me feel like death','Started off with Concerta in May 2012 it was not effective at all, switched over to Adderall XR 10mg in July 2012 for seven days as a starter dose, then started Adderall XR 20mg,  I noticed a considerable difference between the two medicines instantly. I am able to focus for a very long period of time without being distracted, my grades improved exceptionally, I went from receiving grades below 55\% now my lowest grade is 83\%. The benefits of this medicine do outweigh the side effects for me, I noticed 20 minutes after taking Adderall, I have increased bowel movements, lower libido and decreased appetite. I stop taking Adderall during breaks and long weekends, the first day not on it, I am extremely tired, exercising and eating healthy helps.','I have taken Lozartan 50 mgs for about 2 years.

All I can say is that lozartan has too many side effects.','I have been on Latuda for about 2 months now, I take 120mg at about 8-8:45pm every night. Positives are that it makes me have almost no manic episodes and very few &quot;mood switches&quot;. It has also helped with my sleep. Before I was getting about 2-4 hours asleep at most each day. Now with the Latuda I sleep from about 9pm till 10am. The struggles I have with it are that it makes it very very hard to get up in the morning for school or whatever unless I get to sleep in until my body is ready. It has also made it very hard for me to eat. Since starting I have lost nearly 15 pounds. Other than that Latuda has made a huge impact on my life.

Incidentally I&039;m a Registered nurse. I see where a number have people have attributed wild &quot;side effects&039; to this drug. Many are confusing symptoms of their illness with side effects of the antibiotic. Just because you experience something unusual for you when your sick doesn&039;t mean its the fault of the antibiotic. Being ill is an abnormal state for ones body yet some of these people seem to think that any effect of the illness they weren&039;t expecting MUST BE attributable to something else and often they blame the treatment rather than the illness. If you&039;ve been prescribed Levaquin I urge you to take many of these &039;reviews&039; with more than a grain of salt An EXCELLENT drug','This medicine at 5mg a day every day for a month was terrible. It made me have panic attacks and made me super paranoid, i was paranoid before but it made it even worse, would not recommend','My experience with Ovace Plus has been amazing.  I&039;ve tried over the counter shampoo like Nizoral and Loprox (prescription) and nothing has worked for my dandruff like Ovace.  They stopped making it for a while and I freaked out.  Its now back  Please try it, not only did it do wonders for my scalp but it even seemed to help the skin around my hair line in my face.  It was $50 with my prescription but ask the doctor for Ovace discount card and you might be able to get it for $20.  You won&039;t be disappointed.','I take 300 mg 3x a day and I feel the best I&039;ve felt in 10 years. Nothing has worked to calm my anxiety like Gabapentin including Klonopin or Xanax. I&039;m happy, relaxed, motivated and most importantly my appetite for alcohol which I used excessively to calm my anxiety has completely disappeared. I hope I can take this medication for forever. Life is finally good again.','I have severe insomnia, secondary to serious problems with my back.  Basically I need help falling asleep and staying asleep as something as simple as rolling over will cause me to bolt right awake.    I take secobarbital (Seconal Sodium) and temazepam (Restoril). Usually, I take temazepam with Seconal at bedtime and another temazepam during my nightly awakening.  Seconal is not used as a &quot;first line&quot; insomnia treatment any longer.  However, if the weaker sedatives fail you, it really will get you to sleep. Absolute caution is needed, the reputed strength and history of this medication is no joke.

This drug worked well for my depression and anxiety. However, I&039;ve been completely unable to have a good time while on this medication. I can&039;t bring myself to go out, hang out with friends. I do nothing. I have no motivation. The biggest problem I&039;ve had with Zoloft is extreme weight gain. I&039;ve gained 50 lbs in the year.

These thoughts were ruining my life and making me depressed. I was prescribed 50mg per day. The first 3 days were hell with a huge increase in fatigue, depression and intrusive thoughts. I almost gave up it was that bad. I was using diazepam 2mg In those first 3 days and thought they weren&039;t playing nice with the Zoloft so I stopped them. I saw instant improvement after doing so. Now I am 7 days in and have had the best day ever. My intrusive thoughts are far fewer and far easier to simply dismiss.

This works really well.','I&039;m 18 and I&039;ve had the Mirena for about 6 months. I wanted to try a new form of birth control because I always forgot to take the pill and I spotted really bad with the nuvaring. I took pain killers about an hour before the insertion of my IUD On a scale of 1-10 the pain was probably a 3. It&039;s uncomfortable more than anything. There was some pressure, a slight pinch followed by a little cramping but the pain was very mild. My doctor said that light spotting and cramping is expected for about 6 months but I haven&039;t experienced any if that. I went to soccer practice that day and felt 100\% fine. 6 months later I haven&039;t had any noticeable side effects I haven&039;t had a period either. 10/10 would recommend.','I have suffered depression off and on for over 20 years.

I&039;m starting my third Levora pack next week and so far my experience with Levora has been great No headaches, no nausea, no feeling physically weak or overly emotional. My libido is really high and my breasts have gotten a little bigger. I did, however, have the food cravings as mentioned in other comments and it did make me gain a little weight but I notice that when I&039;m taking the reminder pills I&039;m a lot slimmer than when I&039;m taking the active pills.

I have gone as far as taking 100mg until I started not being able to get the words out that I was thinking of. That side effect has not completely gone away but is better. When I first started I did have the tingling in my hands and feet but it was no more than like having carpal tunnel, I also have the weird taste where soda tasted flat and tomatos tastes weird. I did loose a little weight. The tingeling went away, I adjusted to just not drinking soda. And tomatos started to taste fine. I also take Sumatriptan for when I still do get a headache. However the headaches are much fewer and further beteeen. I will get a cluster of them about every six mths but still better.','After breaking both ankles in 1987, I was diagnosed with arthritis in 1997, I put up with mild pain and joint stiffness for years until I started my new job in 2011 at age 45, (7-8 hours a day non stop on my feet) after each shift I would be in so much excruciating pain I wondered if the job was worth it. Went to see my doctor who prescribed 100mg Celebrex twice a day, first few days I noticed a small improvement but also had a bit of stomach discomfort. After a few weeks it was like I had new ankles Little to no pain, so I went down to 100mg a day on days I don&039;t work and 200mg a day when I work. Only other side effect I have had is significant hair loss/ thinning for a couple weeks every 6 months, it grows back though.','I was on Zoloft for Depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Panic Disorder. Initially, Zoloft helped me a lot and I didn&039;t have any kind of panic attacks, a constant sense of mild anxiety, or depression all that bad. However, after about a year of being on it it started to make me feel like a complete zombie. I had zero motivation for anything which reflected in my grades and I&039;m normally an obsessive overachiever in school.. I just kind of let myself go. I wasn&039;t depressed but I wasn&039;t happy, it just put me in this fog-like feeling. The withdraw for me felt like I might as well have been coming off heroin. I couldn&039;t eat or sleep, I had cold sweats, nausea/vomiting, and I had anxiety like never before. It was truly a nightmare.','I have been having gout attacks for about 3 years now. My Dr prescribed allopurinol daily to help keep my uric acid levels down. I was prescribed Colcrys as an anti-inflammatory and I have to say it does absolutely nothing for the pain. My wife who has never had a gout flair in her entire life believes Colcrys is a miracle drug. So I take it just to humble her. I wouldn&039;t suggest this medication to anyone. I wish I could give it negative stars as a review.','I was told by several doctors that I may be bipolar and finally went in to the psychiatrist recently. I was experiencing major mood swings and mixed emotions, paranoia. I couldn&039;t even go to the grocery store without my heart racing and my chest tightening and thinking horrible gruesome thoughts. I have always been on Effexor XR 150 mg a day for my depression and anxiety. The doc added to it 40 mg of Geodon at night to start with, and I have never felt so free. I can think clearly and not dwell on every racing thought. The racing and paranoid thoughts are actually gone and I can handle reality again. I could probably stand to up the dosage a bit but this medicine has been a miracle for me. I have felt amazing.','A couple of years ago I ended up with anxiety and depression. My doctor prescribed Citalopram. I started at 20mg and after a couple of weeks increased my dosage to 40mg. There were side effects. Sweats, waking up at 3:00 and not able to get back to sleep. It took sbout 6 weeks before I felt great. Much happier, little to no anxiety and my wife notice the change for the better. I stayed on Citalopram for about 6 months and over a month kept reducing my dosage by 10mg weekly until I was off the meds. I had no withdrawal at all. Felt great as I went off the meds.  Had some personal problem that sent me sideways and the doctor put me back on Citalopram. took about 6 weeks for it to work just like the first time. Feeling myself again','This product does work. I used to sweat so bad it was not fun. I would never wear a white shirt because it would stain it, even my black shirts would get ruined because of deodorant, so I started buying bigger shirts so that they wouldn&039;t touch my armpits. I could be freezing cold and still have sweat marks. So a friend of mine told me to try this product. I put it off for a few months then I just had enough, saw it in the drug store and said why not lets give this a shot. I noticed a difference after 1 night but did it for 3. The only complaint that I have with this product is how much it stings and burns. I try to make sure I don&039;t shave my armpits the day I want to I put it on and I try to make them as clean and dry as possible. It&039;s totally worth it.','I have had anxiety, panic attacks &amp; obsessive thoughts for years on and off. About 5 months ago I started to get horrible non-stop intrusive thoughts I knew the thoughts/fears/worries were nonsense but I couldn&039;t turn them off. I was in a panic attack from the moment I woke up to the moment I fell asleep. I would wake up several times at night in full blown panic....it was horrible. I never ever wanted to take medicine I was so afraid of it not working or it making me worse. Zoloft has helped me so much at first I had a good day then a bad day  and I wasn&039;t sure if that was normal. after 2 months the doctor upped my dose then a month later I felt better then 100\% still a little anxious during my period  but very mild and manageable.','I&039;ve had the Nexplanon since July 2013. This birth control has been the worst experience. My hormones became crazy, I gained more that 50 pounds, and I get annoyed easily. I have been trying to take the implant off and sadly the new doctor can&039;t feel it. I was sent to 4 different places for exams and nothing still can&039;t pin point where the implant is not even because I have the scar it left when inserted. Here I sit today with a second scar to be since I was cut open today and the implant was no where to be seen. The expiration day is coming in fast.The doctor said he can&039;t do anything until I loose the weight I gained when I got on it, for me that is impossible since nothing helps me loose weight from crazy hormones I have. Idk what to do?','I&039;ve had the Implanon for about 6 months now. The insertion hurt a little bit but it was definitely worth it - the next 3 years of worry free birth control. I absolutely LOVE not getting a period anymore and I truly trust this method enough to not need the reassurance of a period. The ONLY things I do not like about Implanon are the mood swings and weight fluctuation (about 5 lbs more or less). People close to me have really noticed a change in my irritability. I wouldn&039;t consider myself a extremely bad by any means, it is tolerable, I just demand a lot more alone time than I used to. I would recommend this birth control to anyone.','I was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis several months ago.  The pain was so debilitating that I couldn&039;t even see patients for about 3 days (I&039;m a dentist).  The pain brought me to tears.  I was afraid that I would have to go on disibility.  My new urologist put me on amytripyline a few weeks ago.  It worked almost immediately. Most days I&039;m almost pain-free.  I got my life back.','First day of Adipex.. My doctor wrote me a prescription for full dose but advised me to start with half of a pill due to anxiety I may have. Took the half pill this morning and boy do I feel the energy.. Hopefully I can stay on the half strength but I&039;ve been reading reviews that say that the effects wear off after a few days. I&039;m a nurse so I do like the extra energy.. My starting weight is 215..ultimate goal is 165..but for now getting under 200 would be great. Hopefully I can use this extra energy to go to the gym..I&039;ll keep everyone updated. I love reading everyone&039;s weight loss stories.. Good to know I&039;m not the only one who has weight loss as an issue. Best of luck to everyone.. And stay hydrate','This product along with Solodyn has worked great for me. I have been using these products for a little over a month now and my face is mostly clear of acne I definitely recommend this product Now just to deal with the acne marks.','Lots of trouble sleeping and lots of anxiety with this medicine.  It also makes me a bit depressed.  Better if you can take it in the morning instead of later at night.  Works, but there is probably something with less side effects that works just as well.  Usually given this for sinus infections, this is the first time for cystitis.','I wish I&039;d known this page was here before I started this ordeal. I was instructed to drink a bottle of magnesium citrate the evening before. Then around 10 AM I drank the first bottle of Suprep, mixed with water. After the first couple of swallows, I couldn&039;t hack the taste, and started to chase it with (pulp-free) orange juice. I thought it tasted rather like toxic waste not quite camouflaged with chemical cherry flavor. I got it all down, and trips to the WC lasted about five hours. At first, it was every 3-5 minutes, then less often. It was like liquid fire. There was no color anymore in what I was expelling, and I made the executive decision not to drink the second bottle. My poor bum','This was the best birth control I ever used because my almost constant bleeding guaranteed my husband and I would very rarely be intimate. The only extended time I didn&039;t bleed is when they put me on the pill as well. I would bleed about 20-25 days a month. I thought it would get better after 6 months, I ended keeping it for a year, which I regret. 7 months later my bleeding is constant. I bleed everyday, no exaggeration. Sometimes light, sometimes heavier, but everyday. I&039;ve only been married 2 years and I thought I was doing the right thing getting the implant but it ended up taking a huge toll on us. I have seen doctors repeatedly but they say I just have to wait for my hormones to even back out. I&039;ve had it out for 7 months','I suggest if you&039;re going to use these patches that you use them perfectly according to the instructions.     I had imperfect (but not terrible) use and ended up pregnant on my 7th month being on them.     The side effects weren&039;t better or worse for me as compared with other BC. I didn&039;t have some problems with peeling and loosening.','I NEVER write reviews but today I decided to because when I was looking through all the reviews here it really helped me. so I&039;m gonna pay it back and hope to help someone else .... I&039;ve never taken this pill before, never really had to but there&039;s always a first time for everything  So, I took it about 3 hours after my bf finished inside of me . I was freaking out  I freaked out everyday until today when I finally got my period .. I had sex 9/10, and was supposed to get my period 9/26, I got it 9/25. No side effects except mild nausea , and cramps all the way until today  But it worked. So let&039;s thank God and all these people that work making these drugs for us   Hope i could help someone with this review','L-Tryptophan has worked wonders for my insomnia, PMS, anxiety and depression. No side effects, although the bottle sayS take 3 capsules, I ONLY take 1 at night and wake up feeling great.','50 mg/day helps a lot.  Much better than 25 mg/da.  I&039;ve experimented with 100 mg/day and that&039;s much better.  I have dry pants at the end of the day for the first time in decades.  No side effects, but insurance doesn&039;t cover 100 mg/da','We used Malarone during our trip in Tanzania. To tell the truth, we were afraid of some bad comments about this drug. In fact, nothing happened to us. We were taking Malarone every day after our breakfast, so as to avoid an upset stomach. I think that, for malaria, Malarone is a very safe and without serious side effects.','I started with 20mg and stayed on that for 1 month.  I didn&039;t see much of a change in with my issues but was a tiny bit better.  I went to 40mg for 4 months and I felt some improvement but I became depressed again.  I have just started 80mg last week.  I was feeling angry and nervous and not sleeping at all for about 4 days.  I&039;m on the 6th day now and those side effects are almost gone.  I&039;ll update after a little more time goes by.  But I am feeling a little more motivated and awake.','I was getting food stuck n my throat ended up n the hospital they put a balloon down n my chest stretched it open a little &amp; put me on 40 omeprazole it really helps with no side affects that I can tell but if I go over 4 or 5 days without taking it I&039;ll get choked on food but I read u should only take this med for 14 days @ a time.  I have taken 1 for 2 years every morning if I miss for a few days I start getting choked on food again should I keep on taking it? I guess either that or choke to death','This product is just terrific. I can eat ice cream without heating it.  It&039;s a  great product that I highly recommend. I&039;ve tried many of the other prescription options available and this is by far the best.  It needs some good marketing to spread the good word about how it can help people.','Started it last week only took it for 2 days made me very ill stopped it after 2nd dose still poorly 10 days later glad to hear some people are having real benefit from it','I first started using Turmeric about 6 months ago when I had a very bad flare-up of colitis.  I was told to use the fresh root which I placed in my blender with a teaspoon of honey (about 2 small fresh roots will be will be enough for two servings, half cup liquid).  The inflammation started disappearing and in no time there was no bleeding or mucous.  You should take tumeric twice daily until symptoms clear up, then take intermittently. I stopped taking after a while and symptoms started even with meds, but I have now re-started it and feel a lot better.  Tumeric is a Godsend.','Previously I had been on birth control pills, and was looking to try something that had multiple years of coverage. While I did like that it was a long term contraception option, the side effects were unbearable, and I ended up having it removed after only one year. The main side effect that was bothersome was the daily spotting. The spotting ranged from a heavy period flow to a smaller lighter flow. However, it was EVERY SINGLE DAY. I ended up having to wear a tampon or pad just to save my underwear. My OBGYN recommended multiple options to stop the spotting, however nothing helped. Other side effects included a weight gain of 10 pounds and unexpected mood swings. I immediately felt 100\% better after having it removed.','This medication is amazing, but after 2 months I gained 20lbs. :/','I have been on the Carosel of medicines for months now and Geodon has been the only one to help cease the hallucinations and the paranoia but not inhibit my ability to think. Bloating is the only side effect that is uncomfortable so far.','I have taken Velivet for almost 2 years. I&039;ve been getting menstrual migraines from withdrawal sometimes during my period. Also have low libido which I&039;m not sure if it&039;s related to this pill. ','I chose this method after my body rejected 3 IUD&039;s. I had never had a baby, but I wanted a long term and effective method of birth control. I found this to be the best fit for me. I had great success with Depo in the past. I was on it for nearly ten years with only minimal spotting. When I did spot I took estrogen supplements and stopped spotting in a couple days. It didn&039;t hurt at all when I got it. It hasn&039;t given me any problems the whole time I had it. My only concern is what will happen when I get it taken out.','Just started cosentyx-  90 per cent of my body covered have used humira,stellara, otezela and multiple creams without much success 4 days after loading dose my hands were 74 per cent better- I&039;m excited to say this is s great choice w little side effects','I would rather deal with 1-3 days per month of cramps than living every single day of my life with acne, female baldness (was getting there anyway), nausea/vomiting, migraine headaches, skin peeling, no sex drive/inability to orgasm, irritability/crying/depression/anxiety, insomnia, panic attacks, shaking, high blood pressure. Omg - stay away from this stuff if you can ','About 2 weeks ago I had a migraine that lasted for about 3 days until I finally went to the ER. When I was seen, the Dr gave me a mix of Reglan &amp; Benedryl in an IV &amp; boy was that the biggest mistake of my life. At first I felt silly &amp; sleepy &amp; even laughed a little. Then the next thing I know my eyes are wide becuz my heart starts racing like CRAZY I already suffer from anxiety, I wish she would have mentioned the side effects before she injected me with the meds. I would have NEVER taken it via IV. I thought I was gonna die Called the Dr back in &amp; she told me to just calm down. My heart rate finally calmed but then I started shaking. Then came sleep. Woke up &amp; felt a little better. Made me feel depressed a few days later. Traumatized forever','It most definitely works at stopping my attacks when the cold hits. I used to have attacks all day, even if I just opened the refrigerator to take out the milk my hands would turn white. However, I get really bad muscle spasms. Mostly on my legs, but can be all over. I only take it when the temperature is cold and I know I will be outside watching a sporting event. I just started taking it again this week and have been getting muscle spasms in my jaw and behind my ribs as well as my calfs. It is the old things that allows me to be outside to watch my kids games so I will use it on a limited basis.','I have been taking clonazepam .5 MG&039;s once daily if needed for over a year now, and let&039;s just say this medicine has done wonders for me I suffer with horrible panic disorder as well with agoraphobia without clonazepam I probably would never be able to leave my house, I only take it when I need it which is usually three times a week depending but just knowing I have it helps calm me down, I am also on Zoloft 75mgs and the combo works great for me','I love Celexa. I was getting depressed after long hours of med school and studying and feeling like I had no time enjoyment. Celexa took about 3 weeks to work, but it worked and continues to work. I no longer feel depressed every day. Sometimes I sink into depression, but I am able to snap out of it much quicker. I feel less moody, and my boyfriend has noticed an improvement in my mood. The only side effect I experience is decreased sex drive/harder time climaxing, but I would prefer that over going off the deep end. I will continue to take this and consider weening myself from it once life is less stressful. Great medicine that can save your life.','I am new to this medicine. I have been on several other muscle relaxers and they never did a thing for me. After reading what everyone else has said about this muscle relaxer I am praying it will help for me as well. I have a bulging disc in my lower back that is pinching my sciatic nerve which caused me a lot of pain in my left hip. ','I suffered burst fractures, nerve damage, spinal cord damage, due to a bad car accident in September &039;09. Not only has MS Contin worked well, it&039;s relatively inexpensive compared to other extended release medications. People talk about how great the Fentanyl patch is for chronic, severe pain. But you can&039;t control the amount of medicine entering your system, it&039;s unpredictable, certain brands are being recalled because of defective pouches. Plain old morphine. It&039;s been around forever and nothing works as well. The only problem is I&039;ve grown tolerant and needed 2 increases in the past year. I guess that will happen with any medication. With my latest increase (100mg 4X daily) I&039;ve been able to cut down on the oxycodone by half','I have been on percocet for many years and it greatly helps my Chronic pain. Without it I wouldn&039;t be able to walk Only problems I have is constipation','I started the depo a little over 2 years ago but took my last shot in August. Since then I have had normal periods but some times have heavy periods in between my periods so I&039;m almost bleeding a month and a half . I have had horrible mood swings, &amp; horrible cramps. It was great while I was on it, I even lost 50lbs while on it.. But this sucks.','First it helped me breath I was wheezing and coughing terribly. The side effects suck. I get aggressive and irritable. Insomnia is terrible. I can feel swelling in my hands. I can feel my heart beat in my hands when I have fingers interlocked.   I try to avoid all medications but this did help.','Works fine for muscle spasm','I was told that I have Panic Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. After suffering horrible panic attacks from the withdrawals from Zoloft, I was given Klonopin to calm down. For once, everything felt normal. I was calm and collected after that. I&039;ve been on it ever since, I take every couple of days when I&039;m anxious along with Neurontin 300mg, 3 times a day. Definitely helps with the anxiety, I would recommend this to everyone.','I started Contrave daily 3 months ago. Initially, I had a bit of trouble falling asleep and felt mildly light headed and sometimes dizzy and lightheaded  when I was getting out of bed or getting up up from a chair. I did not think this new pill was working for me and then,as I hung in and with patience-I began to lose weight. I am happy to report I have now lost 25 lbs. It has been so very long that I have been able to lose this kind of weight. I a very pleased. Just hope CONTRAVE is safer than the last FDA approved diet pill, that caused heart valve damage.  Lauren R','Although this medication completely alleviated all of the symptoms of psychosis, my mom experienced severe joint stiffness, cramping, muscle pain and weakness. During the 6 months she was on this, she changed from healthy and athletic to a near vegitative state. Currently she is unable to get out of bed or use the restroom on her own.','I was on Loestrin FE for 5 years and I was also diagnosed with bi-polar disorder while I was in high school. Loestrin worked for a little bit but I gained 20 pounds quick. I still had sexual desire mentally but my body wouldn&039;t react and I was always too tired or to moody or to emotional. And since I&039;ve been on it for a while the side effects seemed like they hit me a second time and it was like my period was playing peek-a-boo with me. But 3 months ago I switched to Beyaz and I&039;ve never been more happy and more...well....attacking my fiance. I give Beyaz a 10 and highly recommend it And I&039;m 20.','Today was my first day taking concerta. I am 19 and have pretty severe ADHD and a little anxiety that coincides with the ADHD. I took 36mg at 8:30 am and kicked in at 10. I definitely noticed it, I felt alert and energetic but not focused, and I still found myself pretty forgetful before leaving for work. By the end of work I felt really emotionless and had a head ache, and when I got home at 6 I began crying for no particular reason. After crying I felt much better and focused very well on school work. Now I feel happier but surprised by how much of a roller coaster the whole day was. Overall I&039;m not sure this is the medication for me, hoping this reaction is normal and it just takes some time to adjust.','I have taken abilify for one year. It was prescribed as an add on to Cymbalta after a suicide attempt. I feel it boosts my mood. BUT I have gained 35 pounds. I can&039;t imagine continuing on a medication with this side effect. It is not worth it to switch my angst over life circumstances to feeling depressed over a continual weight gain.','I was in a motorcycle wreck when I was younger. I almost lost my leg. Was in the hospital 4 months.  I couldn&039;t walk for 2 years. Found a new doctor. He operated on it and it healed but I started having problems. My leg was 2 inches shorter then the other. I had broke my leg in 3 places.  Messed up the nerves and all my toes got broke. As each year went by my foot started turning into a club foot. After 17 operations and was told I need an ankle replacement but my doctor told me operation doesn&039;t last and the down time is long. I have chronic pain and I get migraines. Over the years I have been on many different pain meds. Oxymorphone ER has given me more relief then any other. Endo pulling Opana ER but Global has Oxymorphone ER','Rotated me off oxy and onto this for six months.  Works ok.','I have chronic Sinisitis, for 20 years now, typically getting 2-3 sinus infections per year that reduce me to rubble for at least 10 days. I should know better at this point than to try yet another antibiotic, but nothing works anymore except Levaquin, and if I build up a resistance to that, I&039;m in big trouble if I ever get pneumonia. So here I am, up the third night in a row after starting the clarithromycin. I have been nauseous, gassy and utterly uncomfortable--I&039;m not taking another dose, calling my doctor and sticking to natural remedies. If that doesn&039;t work, then looks like I&039;ll be paying out of pocket for surgery since my sinus scan came back normal.','This is the second time I&039;ve had the implant within a two year time period. The first time, after a few months, I had a really bad itch that would never go away. It has gotten so bad to the point that I would bleed and leave myself in pain every night. I tried just about everything to get rid of the itch but the only effective thing was removing the implant. I just recently got it implanted again in January and the exact same thing is happening. Wasn&039;t quite sure at first but now I&039;m more than positive that its a bad side effect of the implant. Total discomfort and wouldn&039;t recommend to anyone.','I have been on Contrave since August, 2016.  To date I have lost 45 pounds and have not experienced negative side effects.  I am able to say no to second helpings and often decline completely foods that I would have readily consumed in excess a year ago. I follow my doctor&039;s instruction to take this medication with a lean protein and I have found this to be  effective for tolerance of Contrave.  The two times I took Contrave on an empty stomach I felt nauseous, so I simply don&039;t take it on an empty stomach.  For me this has helped me tremendously.  I can walk and run farther and faster and my blood pressure is stable for the first time in about 6 years.','I just read most of the reviews and half of them to me are ridiculous, anxiety, and depression?? your period gives you mood swings being a girl you get mood swings  I&039;ve been on this pill since I was 15 I am 22 now never had a problem unless I miss a few pills, I have never been pregnant, very light blood, no cramps, very little pimples to anyone with bad acne and bad cramps I highly recommend this pill. I used to throw up because of my bad cramps and now I rarely even get one','Along with Otezla I had great results No itch, no misery, no side effects other than clearer skin.

I have tried many other pills and have had horrible side effects but with Gildess 1/20 so far so good. I have had very mild side effects ( light nausea and sore breasts) which only lasted two days.

It also made me so tired I couldn&039;t even function   Thankfully she took me off last week and started me on Contrave for my addictive personality (food and cigarettes).  Well this is day 5 and I haven&039;t had a craving for a ciggy yet AND I&039;m down 8 lbs....the key is YOU HAVE TO EAT. You have to eat 5 small meals a day and drink drink drink that water   Incorporate exercise too.  I don&039;t think most people are doing any of the above that&039;s why they have no results I haven&039;t had any side effects (yet, knock on wood).

I didn&039;t abuse the patch I took one 30mg patch a day I&039;m 35 and now it doesn&039;t work like it use to because of one side effect that it gave me so yes use with caution and don&039;t use it everyday if you don&039;t have to','Longer acting steroid option. Gained weight and anxiety.','I only took this medication for a few days, my heart started hurting...I ended up in emergency room my blood pressure had sky rocket and my heart rate was throught the roof. Laying down my heart rate is steady but the moment I stand it jumps to over 150bpm...this never happened until I took this medication. I have been on bed rest for over a week now and so far it doesn&039;t seem to be getting any better.','I try today one levitra 20mg and it had no effect , i am 27 can u inform me what is the problem?   I was with full food maybe it is this problem or maybe I need to use another kind of pill','The first couple nights, I experienced horrible nightmares in which I could not awake from until 2 1/2 hours later when my alarm finally sounded. The next week, my dosage was increased which I experienced severe weakness, dizziness and vomiting. The third week, my dosage was again increased and I experienced the inability to go to sleep.  These side effects caused me to discontinue the medication.','This is one of the only drugs that I don&039;t have any side effects from.','Horrible I read all the reviews before getting it as well the summer of 2014 and decided to follow through with it anyways. I have bled for almost an entire year straight with maybe a two week break the entire time. This made me become anemic, tired, and irritable.  Mood swings were off the charts, I even noticed how ridiculous I acted at times over nothing.  Sex drive was completely gone, which had never been a problem in the past year  Weight gain was absolutely insane. My diet or lifestyle didn&039;t change and I gained a ridiculous amount of weight.  My opinion? Don&039;t waste you&039;re time or money on it. Get the pill even though it&039;s harder to keep a schedule.','I love this form of birth control. I don&039;t have to worry about a pill every day. I don&039;t have periods. It last for 5yrs. All my friends have fears about it because everyones body is different. But I haven&039;t had any trouble with mine and I have had it for 4yrs now.','I have been on this medication for over 3 years. I finally found a medicine that really takes my anxiety away when I have my attacks. It has greatly allowed me to be myself again. Much better then anything else I have ever tried. My Doctor prescribed me this along with 1 mg of clonazepam and I sleep very well considering my previous condition.','I started Latuda six months ago and I got my life back. I initially had an upset stomach for one week, which was relieved with food. No other side effects. After four weeks I felt good and after eight weeks I returned to myself. I had been diagnosed with severe treatment  resistant  depression for 2 1/2 years. I had tried all medications from different classes. I would highly recommend this  drug. Life saver.','I have been given Dilaudid through an IV on several occasions and on all those occasions I&039;d rather just dealt with the pain. Today the hospital gave me Dilaudid, and some nausea medication... On ever occasion that I have been given Dilaudid through IV instantly my head gets too heavy, I begin to get dizzy and lighthead. I always get VERY NAUSEOUS and confused, so I usually sleep it off  because I hate the feeling it gives me. This time was different I fell asleep about 40 minutes after getting the medication and every couple minutes I kept waking up. All of a sudden I became very hot and clamy while feeling very cold.  ','My Don started taking Focalin and started to complain that he could not see the board at school. At first I figured well maybe he is just a kid who needs glasses. His prescription was very low. Now a year and a half later his principal from his school called me because he failed the state eye test with his glasses on he has a 20/50 vision. So I took him back to the doctor and they could not correct his vision with the strongest prescription. Everything is blurry and out of focus, he lost all peripheral vision on both eyes. The doctors first question was &quot;What medication is he on?&quot; So I advised him Focalin 10mg. He advised me to immediately go to the doctor who prescribed it because it is a severe side effect of Focalin. Grrrr','I am 19 with severe testicular pain, at first the doctor prescribed meloxicam which helped but made me sick, then he put me on Vimovo, didn&039;t help at all and I was up all night vomiting. I told him I needed something better. At first he was reluctant to give me Vicodin or Percocet. He later prescribed me Percocet 5/325 and man, that stuff really works, it makes you feel like yourself, no pain, no anxiety, no depression, it is a miracle for me. You must stop as the pain goes and please only take as directed by your doctor as it can become very addicting. A few downsides are: tiredness, nausea (sometimes) and you want to talk a LOT.','I switched to yaz from alesse because I heard it was better for acne. It did wonders for my skin and only having a 4 day period was nice too. However, I did notice that I was more emotional and had crazy mood swings, I found myself crying for no reason (not very good for my relationship either). I didn&039;t gain any weight, and had no other side effects. I only switched back to alesse because my doctor expressed a concern about the blood clots possible with this birth control, otherwise I wouldn&039;t have switched. Goodluck','I&039;m so glad I&039;ve finally found birth control that works for me. I can&039;t do combination birth control pills at all because of it&039;s negative side effects. It&039;s been pretty great so far. Nothing has changed about my weight, I&039;ve actually started loosing a few pounds, but I am more active. I started it on the first day of my period and since then, I have had some spotting, but doesn&039;t bother me. My next period on this pill was extremely light. My periods are usually heavy but it is a plus not to waste money on tampons anymore Only downside is I do notice a few more acne breakouts at time, but it&039;s better than having pregnancy scares It&039;s also great on that aspect, we only use this as birth control and I haven&039;t gotten pregnant so :)','I had a real rough time falling asleep so my doc prescribed Ambien. It worked tremendously but after 3 days I experienced finger joint pain, by the 5th day wrist and finger joint paint was excessive. I will stop using and hope the pain goes away','Was on language for 4 years no side effects was taking 58 units,been on toujeo for 3 weeks and I&039;m beginning to notice a pounding heart beat off and on it started yesterday I hope this passes cause I like the numbers i&039;m getting wasn&039;t getting these kind of numbers with language.','Because of an auto accident a year ago I had a partial separation of my right sacroiliac joint. I&039;ve taken Advil, Celebrex, and Mobic along with steroid injections and received little or no pain relief. Zipsor is the only medication I&039;ve taken that has reduced the inflammation long enough for the joint to begin to heal thus giving my pain relief.','I had bad rls. It went up my arms and down my legs .I am on lamictal 300mg once a day and trazodone 50mg at night. The trazodone seemed to make it worse.  Mirapex did nothing to help the restlessness .  As soon as I was prescribed neurontin, I felt better. 300mg x5 a day.  I would recommend this drug for anyone with rls.','Been taking it for about 4 months, lower back pain gone, heat and cold flashes, testicles shrinking, no sex drive, weight gain, My PSA number was 212 and last checked was 9 so its working. I have stage 4 where it has gone to my bones. Now I am also using Marijuana to see if it helps cancer.. we shall see........','Started at 10 mg up to 25mg. Doesn&039;t help pain but I do sleep better. Extremely dry mouth and skin since I began 2 months ago. Not sure if the sleep is worth the sore dry mouth and skin that when I rub  it, snows dead skin cells everywhere.','Metformin is for &039;PCOS type 1&039;, insulin resistant, becoming insulin resistant, prediabetic or diabetic. If you&039;re like me &amp; have no diabetes/non-insulin resistance, you&039;re &039;PCOS type 2&039;. This great drug is NOT for us My ex PCP &amp; ex Endo both pushed this on me. I took it for almost two years. Over a 2yr span I developed every symptom of hypothyroidism, goitre &amp; my PCOS went crazy I lost 60\% of my hair, choking in my sleep from the goitre &amp; zero energy. I gained 80lbs &amp; my Doctors couldn&039;t figure out why. Got a new Endo, stopped Metformin I&039;m dropping weight &amp; Goitre/hypo GONE Full Thyroid panel was always perfect btw. Google &quot;5 types of PCOS&quot;','I suffered with RA for over 15 years in most of my joints.  6 years ago I moved to a new state and started with a new RA doctor.  She started me on Remicade and lowered the dosage of methotrexate.  I have been pain free for the past 6 years.  Love my doctor and Remicade.','I&039;ve had the Mirena for more than a year now. I&039;m a very young mom and decided to get the Mirena as soon as possible (Which is 6 weeks after giving birth). I heard many horror stories but I knew this was one of my only options. I&039;m glad I went with my gut instinct, I absolutely LOVE the Mirena. It has been completely safe and I have had no bad side effects. After my 5 years are up, I&039;m sure I&039;ll get it again.','Did absolutely nothing to help with the burning or pain. Just made me queasy and turned my pee highlighter orange. Total waste of $5.','My son was just diagnosed adhd today. He&039;s 5 and in kindergarten, and his problems are enough that his school almost kicked him out He will be starting his medicine and working up to the 1mg dose after the week. I&039;m really excited, and hoping to see some lasting changes. If not his dr and I have already discussed uping the dosage, or switching him to stimulates. Hopefully I will be posting again soon. Also if it helps anyone at all, my son is covered under state insurance, and I had to pay no out of pocket expense for his medication.','Not so much of a comment about the effectiveness of Spiriva, but more about the company&039;s &quot;QUALITY CONTROL&quot; which sucks I&039;ve had a ongoing discussion with Boehringer Ingelheim, the company that makes Spiriva for the last year after receiving &quot;blank capsules&quot; in their packages.  At a cost of over $12.00 (in my case) per capsule, this is unacceptable. I honestly expected that this was a isolated incident at first and reported it to the company (and pharmacy) immediately, and again, and again, and again   At first they stated it was a &quot;isolated incident&quot;, then it was  a &quot;equipment malfunction&quot;. Seems like they have a endless supply of excuses, rather than fixing the problem','I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia a week ago and my doctor put me on Savella. I&039;m able to do things I couldn&039;t do before without being so tired. I recommend it to whoever has fibromyalgia. It really does work. Give it a try first before you give up.','Suffered depression, panic and general anxiety in my thirties, tried several other SSRI&039;s and they made me feel worse. Venlafaxine was the one that really improved things for me, take 150mg a day in the morning and life is just much easier to deal with now.','I started taking Lexapro going on 3 weeks ago and I think it&039;s great.  The side effects that I suffered in the very beginning were headaches but they are all pretty much gone.  I also did not put on any additional weight. I actually lost about 4 pounds. It seems to suppress my appetite. I highly recommend it.','I suffered from inherited depression (chemical imbalance). My family doctor put me and my mother on it at the same time. We both were nauseous and had headaches for the first 2 weeks, the subsided. Then we went up a dose after a month to 100 mg and had the same side affects again but then went away. Now we are both happy-go-lucky. Zoloft made me normal again. Which I had forgotten what normal was years ago. Saved my marriage and my life as well. I recommend taking it at night though. ','I&039;ve been taking this for 6-7 years now (started at 20mg then to 40mg now back at 20mg) and I think its time for a change for me. It&039;s stopped working for me in the past 1 year (my anxiety has come back). I also never liked the side effects, mainly: leg muscle spasms at night, easily electrically shocked, and drowsiness.','I had the Nexplanon put in 5 weeks after my son was born and well as far &quot;birth control&quot; it was great. Now the side effects was awful my arm would randomly hurt I gained a ton of weight and my periods where way out of whack. its a 50/50 thing for me the side effect where not worth it.','Works wonders on lower back pain but sometimes needs a narcotic pain killer or muscle relaxer for days when pain is more severe.  Downside of this drug is that taking too much causes excruciating abdominal cramping and stabbing gas pains in the intestines.  But it&039;s an 8-hour pill, so pain relief usually lasts and it is not hard to space doses out since it lasts so long.','This medication is terrible. My insurance switched me to the generic last year. I took the medication for several months, and was miserable the entire time. I was noticeably irritable and extremely anxious. I stopped taking the medication and switched back to ortho tri cyclen lo and the problems went away. I am currently waiting to receive information on my new insurance, and ran out of ortho. I had an extra pack of tri lo sprintec and decided to give it another try. I regret this, because just a few days into the medication, I am once again anxious, grumpy, and miserable. Maybe it will work for you, but it definitely doesn&039;t work for me.','I just started taking Zoloft. I am a 16 year old male suffering from severe social anxiety. I was never like this before a of couple months ago. Anyway I started taking it about 5 days ago. At first my anxiety got worse. But today I didn&039;t feel all that bad and just hoping it gets better from here. We will see. Also only side effects. Slight headache here and there.','Works great against allergy (25mg) and also somewhat against asthma (due to the anticholinergic properties: dilates the airways). When taking Atarax I can reduce the amount of asthma reliever medication (terbutaline). Side effects: Drowsiness (in the beginning), headache (disappeared after the third pill), muscle twitches and some muscle aches.','An update from my post in April 2013.  I have been on Stribild for over two years now.  I have been undetectable since (two months after starting).  I have had no side effects and it&039;s easy to take.  I take it every morning with breakfast (that works for me).  Stribild is great, I have no complaints.  Gilead copay assistance makes my copay free; so that&039;s fantastic as well.  It&039;s devastating to find out the news you&039;re HIV positive but it&039;s great to know there&039;s medicines like Stribild to make that situation manageable.','Taken for 2 months. Hate it. Side effects are awful :( HEADACHE, LOSS OF ENERGY, BONE/JOINT PAIN, RINGING IN EARS, NUMBNESS/TINGLING OF HANDS and TOES, LIGHT HEADED, CONFUSION, VISUAL ISSUES, SENSITIVITY TO LIGHT, COUGH, MUSCLE PAIN,STOMACH ACHE, TOO MUCH TO LIST. Does bring pressure down but may not last 24 hours. After 3 weeks my bp was finally lower than 140/90 in the mornings. Next appointment I&039;m off this drug. Can&039;t take it :(','I had NO pain control on this medication, but from reading the other posts, I was not given a chance at it. My MD tried one small dose and NOTHING for breakthrough pain. It seems that if he&039;d adjusted it and given me something for break through pain maybe I would have had a good outcome, too. Sadly, I have no health insurance now and it&039;s too expensive, so maybe he did me a favor. It would&039;ve been brutal to finally have a medicine work and it be too expensive to buy.','Worked fine at first and then after about 6 months when I took the shot, it would take 2 hours for any thing to happen.','Paxil does help with depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder. It makes you lose weight but the weight comes back fast when you stop taking it.','I had taken this birth control a year ago, then went off it because I just didn&039;t need it. I&039;ve started it again, I just started my third pack. I don&039;t have acne problems, the only thing I used to have trouble with was horrible cramps that would cause me to be bed ridden for couple of days, but my period was always light. This has for sure taken care of that, I rarely ever get cramps now. The only things I have noticed are I got moody during the first month, and when I do get a blemish (zits, nicks and cuts, bug bites), they tend to last longer. And in the last two weeks, I have noticed my stomach has bloated. My scale says I only gained under 5 pounds, and there is no change anywhere else on my body weight-wise.','I&039;ve had the implanon for about 5-6 months now. I&039;ve gained about 8 pounds within those months. It is a very effective birth control, but I&039;ve never been so moody and angry in my life. Ever since I&039;ve got it my boyfriend and I have noticed my moods being completely different and awful. Not only have I gained weight, but its also making me break out really bad.  My acne will not go away no matter what I try to use.','I have suffered from severe plaque psoriasis for ten years. I have taken every biologic medicine that is available and Stelara has been by far the BEST. It has totally changed my life the past two years and the GOOD news is my dermatologist said it is not one of the medicines that eventually stops working like the others. If it clears you and you are healthy with no major side effects its possible to live a psoriasis free life for years The side effects of many biologics were harsh especially Remicade but the last two years on Stelara I have only noticed a bit of fatigue and only one upper respiratory infection.','Multiple statins over years caused severe muscle aches in lower body, fatigue, stomach pain and scary loss of memory and focus.  Took months but dramatic improvement after stoppage. Have talked to many people with identical experiences. Been on ezitimibe two months. Experiencing pain and swelling in left hand, wrist and forearm, body fatigue, sudden short bouts of liquid diarrhea, waking up during night sleep absolutely drenched and awash in perspiration, loss of muscular strength and increasing loss of mental focus. Talked today to a friend having comparable symptoms. Stopping this drug immediately.','I have struggled with anxiety/depression/insomnia my whole life. Nothing ever had any noticeable effects until I was prescribed Celexa back in 2007. I was on it for years, then decided to try life without it and was tapered off. The thing about Celexa (and all antidepressants) is they work well in that you wont spend as much time crying and all that but they also inhibit you from feeling genuine euphoria You just stay at a base-line. ','I used doxycycline hyclate for my bronchitis. It really helped me get better faster, it even got rid of the few zits I had. The downfall is after I was done with my prescription I broke out all over My face, neck, and chest are all covered in acne or its a rash, I&039;m not sure... I&039;ve never had bumps this bad in my entire life','After about a week of headaches and migraines with no relief despite taking every treatment I had available, I went to the ER. The doctor mentioned Reglan as a treatment option and I accepted. I got Reglan in an IV, and a few minutes later I just started to feel very anxious. Everything just felt very urgent and I felt very restless. My face also started to feel hot. I also was alone during this visit, which I&039;m sure didn&039;t help. I also suffer from anxiety, so it just increased my usual symptoms. My migraine relief was only so-so; it came back the next day. Reglan might be a good option for you if your migraine is really bad, but be careful because it can make you really anxious.','great drug with few if any side effects.... especially in adults.','So my doctor prescribed this medicine for me yesterday, so far I&039;ve taken 5 pills since then (3 doses a day). She prescribed it to me to regulate my period and stop my blood flow as I&039;ve had 3 periods since Janurary 30th. Now, here I am, assuming that this would actually work as it was recommended by my gyno. Completely wrong. Ever since I&039;ve taken it I&039;ve had non-stop cramps and been very uncomfortable, my period is still yet to stop, and I still have all the typical emotions that come along with periods. I hardly ever even get cramps and when I do, they hardly hurt. So it&039;s definitely the medicine causing these pains. Also, this medicine is basically just a higher form of ibuprofen. Wouldn&039;t recommend to anyone with period problems','The first couple of weeks, it seemed to help, but then I developed a bad case of thrush, even though I rinsed and gargled after each use.  I did not swallow it. I have had the 5 pills to suck on every day for 14 days and now the Nystatin to swish, gargle and swallow. I am much better now, but I took myself off the Symbicort. I am also on a lot of other medicines but the one I absolutely need is phenytoin, due to a brain aneurysm. My mother had esophaguel candida and was on Diflucan all the time, and I have had my share of yeast infections also.','My 10-year son has ADHD (combined) and ODD. Focalin XR so far is the only medication that works on my son&039;s inattentiveness. However, on 15 mg he was very moody and glassy eyed. Found out later that he was overmedicated. What I didn&039;t like about Focalin was that he became very quiet almost Zombie like. Also, the medication did not last in his system long enough. He stopped takes Focalin XR over a year now and has been on Vyvanse (70mg.) I am considering putting him back on Focalin with a lower dose.','Made me sick on my stomach, very dizzy and felt it made my kidneys hurt ','I got this medicine in September and my face got bad then cleared up, but i kept going through a cycle: clear up, get better over and over. It&039;s mid December now and I haven&039;t cleared up in weeks. I also have back, shoulder, and chest acne. It did nothing to that. I&039;m going to switch antibiotics soon','I&039;m 48 years old, and my Doctor has recently prescribed me Estrace Vaginal Creme because intercourse was becoming unbearable. Very painful and I was tearing Geez  So far, the vaginal pain and dryness seems to be decreasing, as I&039;ve been only using the creme for the past month. I have no side effects at all so far. That&039;s a good thing However, I do find the creme very expensive','I took this for BV and it&039;s been mostly fine. I&039;m just really bloated and it can get uncomfortable, also inconvenient to have to fart ALL the time.','I would not recommend this to anyone. When it came to putting it in I&039;m told it&039;s nothing more than a small pinch. I couldn&039;t use my arm for 3 days from the intense pain of getting it inserted. Then I&039;m told it will help regulate my period, we&039;ll that couldn&039;t have been farther from the truth. Periods lasting 12-14 days cramps and all, and spotting the rest of the month almost completely non stop for over 18 months. Then I finally give up and have it removed. It&039;s only then that I&039;m told the longer it&039;s in the harder it can be to get back out. The doctor ends up spending 25 minutes digging around trying to get ahold of it. Day 5 of severe arm pain.','After reading horror stories about birth control online, I was very nervous to start taking the pill. I decided to try Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo, and it was the best decision I could have made. I never gained a single pound, my mild acne disappeared and my periods became regular, light and short. I should also add that I have unprotected sex regularly and have never had a pregnancy scare. This pill worked wonderfully for me and I honestly believe that its the best birth control out there.  CON: I only experienced one side effect from this birth control pill: Every month, after taking the first pill of the pack, I experience intense nausea. THIS SIDE EFFECT DOES GO AWAY after time.','I was prescribed Sertraline a few days ago after having a severe panic attack (yet again). After explaining my family history to the doctor he concluded that my anxiety was probably caused by an underlying depression/ slight bipolar disorder that was never diagnosed or treated. As much as I tried to wish I was &quot;normal&quot; and denied having the same issues as many of my family members I just have to accept that I have inherited that gene. I am still nervous about being on medicines but I am hoping it helps to get my emotions under control.','Wow I LOVE this medicine I am excited about the hope of bigger breast, aren&039;t we all ladies? It apparently has increased my sex drive. I am 35 years of age, married for 18 years and have 5 children. I cannot say anything bad at all about this medication, I love it Oh yeah, it regulates my periods so as I have them more often with less cramps, I also have lighter periods, which is always a plus.','Since the age of 11 I suffered with cystic acne and later in life I had cysts on my face, chest, back and breasts, and inner thighs. Constant blood and drainage of pus was a regular everyday event for me. After being prescribed Accutane my life changed. Nothing had ever worked. I used every soap, cream and antibiotic known to man with no results whatsoever. My acne went away and stayed away. It was like a miracle Later in life I was put on the generic form and was not pleased at all. It did nothing.','I have been on lexapro 4 days 5mg and found I have nausea and feel very restless and more anxiety I also have the a strange feeling in my leg not sure whether to keep going with medication. My heart feels like it is racing but that could be from the anxiety. Not sure I can rate this so early in taking it.','I have been on Depo now for over 20 years - I should be paid to be their poster child. It was the miracle medicine for me and my body. After 10 horrific years of monthly hell, I started Depo. Immediately, the periods went away, my hormones balanced and I literally regained my life. I have had no long term effects, no weight gain, no side effects at all. For the right person, this works amazingly well. For others, it does not. But it IS worth a try','My life before this god send medicine was awful agitated, stressed with no reason, light depressed I couldn&039;t think straight. 2 months of taking this drug felt it  relieved all . I take only 10mg of cipralex. Please all IBS suffers I know what painful IBS are and embarrassing. please don&039;t give up try this you wouldn&039;t feel relieved for awhile may be 1 or 2 or 3 months  but it will work - don&039;t give up. I hope IBS suffers find this helpful for them.  thank you a&039;ll','I&039;ve been on this pill since January (it is now July) and sadly I&039;ve developed cystic acne from it and now I&039;m on accutane. If I would&039;ve realized sooner that it was the culprit, I would&039;ve stopped immediately. I took this pill in the first place for my acne only. I was someone who had moderate acne and this cystic acne has made me so depressed. If you notice changes in your skin 4/5 months in that aren&039;t good, I would say to change your pill. My problem is that I read reviews saying it would get better and it just gradually got worse. I also read reviews that said your skin would get used to it before it got better and that wasn&039;t true for me at all. Save yourself before it gets worse definitely. Wish I could put pictures of my acne here :(','Best medicine on the market, unfortunately my insurance company refuses to pay for it which usually means I end up with bronchitis at least twice a year.','I began Pristiq about 6 months ago. At first, it worked better for me than any I&039;ve ever taken. Now, though, I have days when I feel like it&039;s not working very well. I am considering trying something else, but I&039;m still not sure. I wish there was an antidepressant that would continue to work forever....','I&039;ve been taking this for a while, and as a fairly small lady, the side effects can be a little much at times. Sometimes it causes really nasty headaches behind my eyes due to my contact lenses. Also, I tend to get stomach pains that happen at random times throughout my cycle. However, it has kept my cycle very regular, and reduced my period from seven days to four. Great if you have irregular cycles, but the side effects can be a tad overpowering if you&039;re not prepared.','I&039;ve been on Xolair for 4 months, 2 shots 1 time a month and now as I approach my 5 month. Doctor is talking about decreasing my Advair. I currently take 500 of Advair and have not had to use my rescue inhaler in a very long time. I was diagnosed with COPD about 6 years ago, but my symptoms have totally reversed themselves and I am doing very well. The Doctor tells me that I may only get down to 100 of Advair but I think my asthma is doing great. Xolair is a great medicine.','I absolutely love the skyla. I&039;ve had it in for about 9 months. I was 21 at the time, no kids, and insertion was a little uncomfortable but bearable. Felt like bad period cramps. I had my period pretty heavy for the first month or so and then one day it was gone and I didn&039;t have it again for a few months. Every once in a while when I do get my period it&039;s pretty light with some cramping  (average period I would say) for a week or less. I highly recommend this. I don&039;t feel it at all and my husband doesn&039;t either.','It tastes bitter but goes away in the morning and isn&039;t really bothersome because you are finally asleep.','My advice. Be Extra careful and ready when being sexually active. Birth control is the best contraception However, plan b was a life saver. It took a week for my body to take any kind of response. I was dizzy and nauseous, and had my period a week later. I was just like you all reading reviews hoping for a sign it was going to work. So much I was in tears and stressed to the max. It DOES work and sit back and relax, let the medicine do its job. It is pricey, but it is effective. Worth the $.','I have been taking 50 mg of Metoprolol Succ for 5 years and my blood pressure recently became very variable.  At times it was very well controlled but then it would spike.My cardiologist added 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily.  I&039;d taken  it years ago and it caused my sodium to go quite low-122.  The doctor that prescribed stopped This doctor convinced me to try it again and she would check my sodium and potassium.  I took it for three days and developed several side effects including dizziness, vision changes, mild chest pain, severe constipation and both upper and lower abdominal pains.  Doctor said  stop it. i checked my diary and sure enough I&039;d been having severe constipation and abdominal pain last time I took it.','I have been taking APRI for about 4-5 months and love it. It has not made me any more moodier or has not changed my sex drive and my periods are way normal.','My doctor put me on Sulfamethoxazole in hopes of clearing up a mild but reoccurring skin infection under my arms. I was instructed to take 2 pills per day for 2 weeks.  My first, second and third day I felt okay, but the fourth - ninth day (today) I have felt very tired, shaky and dizzy.  When I turn my head a certain way, or lay down, I feel as if I spun in a circle ten times, then stopped. I called today, and spoke with a nurse who assured me that I would have had the side effects the first or second day. Well, I know my body and I don&039;t feel right. So today will be my last day on this.','I took minocycline for about a month for acne and I started to get dry eyes after 1 month I went to the eye doctor and they said my tears weren&039;t as good as they should be, I strongly believe that the minocycline caused my dry eyes. They get tired during the day. I have read that certain acne medications cause dry eyes. It&039;s horrible I have the dry eyes every day. Don&039;t take this drug at all.','I have had migraines for almost 40 years. I have the type where I lose my central vision and have a halo effect for appx 45 minutes, then horrible pain sets in, and throw up for several hours. This will last for appx 8 hours, then the pain eases off and lingers for almost two days. I usually ended up at the hospital where I have had Demerol, Imitrex, etc, which did not work.  One day I lost my vision, and tried Excedrin Migraine. This stopped the migraine cold. Never before had any medication even slightly reduced my pain and nausea. This was 14 years ago. I take two as soon as I start to lose my vision, wait until the halo effect subsides, then I can go about my day. Excedrin Migraine returned my life to me.','Been using it for over a month now, still the same amount of spots if not even more, has not worked for me, time to visit the GP again','I began taking Trazadone to help with insomnia about two months ago.  The first time I took 25mg (cut the 50mg pill in half) and it worked getting me to sleep, but left me groggy the next day. The next time I tried 12.5mg by cutting the 25mg section in half and that amount helps me get to sleep and leaves me feeling normal in the morning.  I was suffering from a bad bout of 2 months of insomnia.  Trazadone saved me','I&039;ve been taking tizanidine tablets for about five years, the dosage is low - 2mg at night for Fibromyalgia. It helps with the body aches that prevent me from sleeping through the night. I have not experienced any side effects other than dry mouth and thirst when waking up.','This is definitely miracle cream, no doubt about it. I have been using it for about 14 years on my hands to treat eczema breakouts. However... I was not warned about using it for long term treatment and my doctor gives me refills when I ask for it. I am only now finding out about possible nasty steroid withdrawal symptoms if I stop using it.  After using it for such a long time I&039;m concerned but I plan to stop using it for awhile to see what happens.','I started using the pills on 01/08/16. I am 5&039;10 and I weighed in at 278 lbs. I weighed myself today (01/11/16) and I&039;m 270.8lbs. My goal weigh is to weigh 200lbs. I walk in the treadmill for 20 mins, 100 sit-ups, I started doing 20 squats a day and I&039;m doing butterflies with dumbbells. I&039;ll post back on my next visit with my doctor (02/04/16).','I&039;ve been to the ER for migraines too many times to count and have been given every kind of drug that can be given. I woke up this morning with a horrific migraine and vomiting and off I went. They gave me the Reglan/Benadryl combo and within less than a minute the pain was gone. I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT I&039;ve never had anything to work so well and so fast. I went home and slept for four hours afterwards. I&039;m so glad they decided to try this with me.','My IUD was inserted two years ago and it&039;s AMAZING. Between the age of 16-18 I&039;ve gotten pregnant three times. I&039;m very fertile. After I had my daughter I decided to get this Birth Control. When the Dr. Inserted it, I didn&039;t have much pain. The procedure was quick and easy. I had some spotting. My period is the same as it&039;s always been. Since my IUD was inserted I haven&039;t gotten pregnant. My boyfriend and I always have unprotected and I haven&039;t gotten pregnant yet. I love this Birth Control because once its in you don&039;t have to worry about it. You do a weekely inspection to feel for the strings and make sure it&039;s in place, and that&039;s it. I recommend the Paragrad IUD every time the &039;Birth Control&039; conversation comes up. I Love it.','I lost a family member, was on last semester of college, working part-time and the mild depression I had became a severe problem. I had dark thoughts and did not wanted to associate with anyone. Quit my job and had to apply for public assistance when my depression became a serious problem. I am now taking Wellbutrin XL 150 mg a day since May 11 and at first I had dry mouth but it only lasted a month. I have not lost weight and my appetite is good. I am feeling much better but I think that one pill is not enough. Psychotherapy is also another help that goes hand by hand. Also I stop smoking a month ago. I also had to improve my life style doing exercise a few times a week, meditation, aromatherapy and eating habits.','April 2016 out of the blue after having normal cycles and 5 pregnancies, I started hemorrhage and passing softball size clots. My doctor started me on 10 mg provera and that slowed down the bleeding. It has been 42 continuous days of bleeding then they raised the provera to 20 mg. They worked for two months then started spotting. They raised to 30. Well now I&039;m on 40 mg.. I&039;m not liking some of the mood side effects. I&039;m not sure if this medication is for me..','Absolute BEST ','I was worried about how my body would react to the Nexplanon after reading all these reviews, but I love it No period, don&039;t have to worry when I have sex, and I don&039;t forget to take a pill. Only complaint is that I get a little nausea when I wake up but it goes away. Plus it was free with my health coverage AND my libido is back.  My husband is happy about that one too.','I am a 5&039; 8&quot; male 175 lbs and have Chlamydia for the second time :(. First time it took me 5 months to realize I had infection, I was having the testicle pain thinking it was too much sex Then a physician recommended doxycycline for a week and it went away. Now, I just took 2x500mg of azithromycin. I had breakfast 2 hrs earlier, cereal and fruit. Two hours later only small stomach discomfort. I am drinking plenty water. Lets wait a week to see if it goes away. Cheers','After years of severely painful and agonizing 7 day heavy periods, my doctor recommended Levora.  I have been on this pill for over a year now and it has been amazing. Only side effects I have had are positive- my boob size increased an entire cup and I have just about no acne My periods have also shortened to less than 3 days and they are extremely light, no pain or headaches anymore either. My period comes the same time, same day, every single month. I was petrified to start birth control but I couldn&039;t stand the horrible periods anymore. I am so happy my doctor suggested Levora as I no longer lose sleep laying awake in pain This pill has done wonders for me','Hyped me up like crazy.  Made anxiety worse.  No depression help.  Gives lots of energy.','This is my third time on vesicare. After seeing several doctors with symptoms of UTIs and having pathology determine there was no infection I was diagnosed with urethral syndrome. I usually take 5mg per day and the condition clears up within a week and I can stop the medication. No more tenderness, spasms or urgency. Some dry mouth, but that&039;s easily solved.','Well great with the bad. Been using this medicine for two months now. This product worked great. It cleared my sinuses and got rid of the allergies, and it opened up the tubes from my eardrum to my throat where they could drain. But after two months I started getting joint pains, shoulder pains, bad and neck and other joints. It got so bad last week I went to the Doctor and had X-rays done, just some mild wear and tear about it. Then I got to looking up reviews and there it was a lot of joints pains and some mild aggression, moody.  Well that summed it up never before had this trouble before Flonase. ',' I Have Struggled with adhd for 10yrs an finally my doc did something about it:) However I did have sleeping problems for first few weeks but that was expected with it being a stimulant but after a month or so my sleeping is back to normal and my mind is not spinning out of control so THANKS DOC  ','I&039;m in week 3 of my first packet and have broken out around my mouth and under my nose and it seems to be spreading.  I have had a couple breakouts on my chest as well.','I was diagnosed with severe GERD and Barrett&039;s Disease several months ago.  I tried everything and nothing seemed to work until now.  Kapidex has been amazing.  I have had no side-effects and at my last gastroscope, everything was looking A LOT better.  Kapidex, along with following GERD food guidelines has made me feel 100\% better.','I really enjoyed smoking but heart disease rings strongly throughout my family. I wanted to live to see grandchildren so I decided I needed to quit. My doctor prescribed Chantix. I only took Chantix for two and a half weeks. I haven&039;t smoked for a year and a half. I would recommend Chantix to anyone wanting or needing to quit smoking. I had no side effects. I actually slept wonderfully while taking Chantix.','I have only been on this pill for 3 weeks now, but wanted to insert my experience because it seems pretty different than some of the other reviewers. I had light spotting for about a week and a half four days into taking the pill, then it completely stopped. I didn&039;t experience any other side effects until the next week: dizziness, lightheadedness, and something I can only describe as a &quot;mental cloudiness.&quot; These effects would normally last 15 hours after taking the pill (I take it at 9PM). Nothing I do could help it--eating, drinking water, you name it. Feels kind of like I have morning sickness or something until 2PM, but I would like to add that that is not consistently every day. I take my pill at the same time every day.','I use Lomotil to control diarrhea which occurs sporatically following anal cancer treatment.  This is a miracle drug for me.  Greatly improves my quality of life.  I don&039;t take it regularly, but it is reassuring to know I have it when needed.  Immodium AD just doesn&039;t work; Taking it regularly was a waste of money.  Lomotil has never made me constipated, though I have noticed mild nausea recently.  This does not occur everytime I take it.','In use for 6 weeks with noticeable reduction in muscle soreness and overall general body stiffness. Suffered for years with stiffness, soreness, lack of flexibility, and difficulty getting down on a floor to work and very hard to get up. Weight doesn&039;t help, but Mobic has relieved much of the apparent inflammation of muscles and joints. So far after 6 weeks I have no noticeable side effects.','My husband and I have been trying to conceive number 2 for 9 months. I have PCOS and was not ovulating on my own. My husbands tests also showed a low sperm count. Our first pregnancy was planned and conceived first week of trying. This time has been much harder and very trying. My specialist recommended either clomid or straight to IVF. I have been taking clomid for 3 months, first month 50mg did nothing and second month took 100mg and ovulated but did not conceive. I definitely know when I ovulated whilst taking clomid it was very obvious. Just finished round 3 100mg. Also had side effects on clomid such as hot flushes, mood swings and dizziness. Very emotional this time round. Fingers crossed.','My son is in his early 20&039;and has schitsoaffective dissorder.He has been on at least five different medications for his illness. And nothing seem to help or if it did it lasted only for a little while or he had severe allergic reactions.  So he started clozapine/clozaril around a month ago. And it has made a big difference .The voices gradually are going away. He can actually sit and watch TV and have a conversation. He is enjoying things again. We do go for blood work every week which he does not mind. This medicine is working and I&039;m hoping his blood work comes back good every week, Because to see him getting better is such a relief . And I am hopeful for a happy productive life for him. Things are looking up.','This medication helped with my allergies greatly The only problem is that it stung a little when first using it.','For those of you having trouble paying for lyrica, my doctor recommended I use the prescription card they offer on their website. . Hope this helps','I took Cipro for a sinus infection along with bronchitis. It worked very well but I didn&039;t like the fact that I had to avoid dairy and take my multivitamin at a small window of opportunity during the day.  Cipro made me very tired and weak, also a little fuzzy. Plus side was I slept great at night and it cured my infections.','Latuda has been a lifesaver. I&039;ve been battling crippling depression, suicide attempts and extreme mania. I have been through it all, tons of money and success to literally living out of a van. Latuda has completely equalized me and has allowed me to live a normal life. Bad akathesia as a side effect but if I take it at night I&039;m ok. Make sure to take this drug with food, that&039;s vital  Give it a try it may save your life :)','I suffer from an eye inflamation disorder, and am on doxy for life, so when i had a UTI recently I just upped the dosage - Thought I would share a few of the more common side effects with you. 1st is Nausea - if you shock your system with it (Doxy is a VERY powerful broad spectrum antibiotic) by taking too much too quickly you are likely to get lightheaded and nauseous about an hour after taking it - symptoms persist for another hour or so, and then goes away - best bet is spread it out but with a lower dose - 50mg 4 x a day is just as effective as 100mg twice a day, but causes MUCH fewer symptoms. Secondly - this WILL destroy your natural gastrointestinal flaura and after 3 days or so you will get looser stools and your gas will be BAD','I have had  diverticulitis attacks 2 times/year for several years and have been successful treating it with Keflex or Cipro. For whatever reason my gastro MD added metronidazole in combo with Keflex this time. After 4 days I&039;m stoping the metronidazole because of side effects. Metronidazole did not ease the diverticulitis pain faster (still took 3 days for pain to subside) and it has made me tired, lethargic to the point of not even getting dressed. Pressure in my head and severe cramps. Im a high energy upbeat person and this droopy soul doesn&039;t suit me. I&039;ll stick to the Cipro, change up my probiotic and avoid flagyl in the future','Have been on depo for probably around 2 years since I was 21. I chose the injection for convience and to help with my periods as they are heavy and extremely painful often making me vomit from excessive pain. First year of being on depo was ok would still always spot and would always get a period before my 3months was up. I swapped backw to the pill for two months then went back to the depo because I was forgetting to take my pill and did want to risk pregnancy. Going back onto the injection was the worst decision I could have made. I have been back on it for at least 12 months and I bleed after 2months for about 2weeks and currently I have been bleeding for over 1 1/2 months. Never getting this shot again','I took a fatal dose of Heroin in February 2016 and was given 2 shots of Narcan and it saved my life','I started Myrbetriq about three weeks ago.  What a difference it has made in my life.  The doctor gave me samples for 25 mg and I noticed a positive change the first day and even more after a few days.  When my two week supply of samples ran out, I requested to try the 50 mg and this level has almost completely alleviated all the symptoms I was having.  Now I&039;m battling with my insurance company to approve the medicine.  Hopefully they will come through for me because this medication is working great.','I had only had a mild SLE flare about 30 years ago. I had plenty of the discoid lupus symptoms, but they were easily controlled with avoiding the sun and using sunscreens,especially in the last 20 years. I developed another auto-immune problem about 15 years ago.(gluten intolerance or or possible CD.) I ate the &quot;gluten-free&quot; Cheerios when they hit the shelves about 6 months ago, and almost killed myself, as they were not gluten free. This touched off a SLE flare of unbelievable proportions Practically every joint in my body was hurting SO badly,and I had fever and fatigue and did not respond to NSAIDs.  Placquenil has been my lifesaver Adhering to an anti-inflammatory diet for a month helped, also. The price-worth it.','After reading all the reviews I was kind of skeptical about taking contrave but decided to try them anyways hoping for a positive experience. I started them on Monday August 21 and felt fine the whole morning then about 1pm that day it went nothing but downhill. I had nausea,vomiting, headaches, flulike symptoms, light headed and ears ringing. I could not do anything but lay in bed I felt so bad. This is day 3 and I still have the headache and not feeling 100\%. Some of the reviews  said to try and stick it out at least a week but after the reaction I  had these pills are going in the trash, I just hate the fact that my insurance didn&039;t cover so I am out of $99','I&039;ve been on LoLo since July (8 months) and I only have positive things to say about this pill. I began this rx because I wanted something super low dosage and to help mediate the horrendous pain associated with my periods. Well, I haven&039;t had a period since August, which is so wonderful for me No weight gain, no break outs, but I have noticed lately that each month, about a week before my inactive pills, I&039;ll experience some major breast tenderness and soreness. Am I alone in feeling that?','This is horrible. Never in my life I felt like this ever. I think I am going to die. mMy goodness','I was prescribed Nitrofurantoin 100mg for treatment of a urinary tract infection, 4 times daily with food. I started taking them and after the second tablet I felt so nauseous that I couldn&039;t move. I continued taking the tablets even though I was aware they were causing the nausea, however the nausea became so bad I ended up vomiting and been taken to A&amp;E.','This ended up being the end of my relationship with my GI. He wouldn&039;t accept that it was making me very ill. He told me to just keep taking it. This was 6 months in. I decided to quit it and him at the same time. My GI was a narcissist, anyways..','I can say I&039;ve had nothing but great experiences since having it placed last June. I was on the pill for 3 years before finding out about the implant. On the pill I gained about 30lbs but thought it was my only option. I decided to get the implant as I had been forgetting to take the pills, and my Dr said it was the most effective form of birthcontrol around right now. The placing of the implant was painless, just a little uncomfortable. I got regular period the two months after the insertion, and have not had a period since, which I love. I really haven&039;t had any side affects, except for losing about 20lbs (back to my normal weight prior to the pill) so I&039;m not complaining. Uncomfortable at times (if I sleep on my arm), but I rarely notice it there','The condom came off during sex, he came outside of me and some landed on the outside of my vagina. I was panicking so about three hours later went to target, got the pill, and took it. The 1st day I had no side effect. I didn&039;t have any side effects for another two days. I was freaking out at that point cause I wanted the side effects to know it was working. Monday got a bit heated with the making out .After that I felt a bit nauseous and had some minor cramps. Went home and applied a heat pack and still got some cramps and a bit nauseous still. Tuesday I had some bad cramps like they were painful  and around third period I got my period which is a week early. So just relax and let the pill do its work','I have recently been put on Tramadol for chronic migraines, in conjunction with a daily preventive medicine. I did not experience any euphoria, nor do I have any problems when I don&039;t take it.  The problem is, I don&039;t receive any pain relief from my migraines when I do take it.  I&039;ve tried so many different medicines and was hoping this might be the answer. I was wrong.','I have been on it 8-9 weeks? Only side effect I have had outside the last two days is loss of appetite which is wonderful for a binge eater like myself. You not only get full sooner, you almost feel sick. I don&039;t mind, reminds me I need to keep myself in check.  Until the last two days, I have not had the nausea and vomiting others seem to have. I don&039;t know why it decided to start. Vomited two days in a row now. Hope it doesn&039;t continue, I otherwise love it.','I&039;ve had acne for 10 years and this is the only thing that has worked. I&039;ve been on a few other prescription medications and they didn&039;t have the same results. My skin does get dry but I just use a non-comodegenic moisturizer (Cetaphil) and it helps immensely. My skin is clear and it feels smooth. Don&039;t let the other reviews about redness and irritation scare you off. You should just reduce your usage to every other day instead of every day and it still works. Also the claims that it causes more acne is unlikely since it has TWO acne-killing medicines in it. If you use it correctly and how it best fits your needs, I promise you won&039;t be let down.','I took Diovan for two months to reduce blood pressure.  It appears to be working, with no apparent side effects, other than COST.  It is not available as a generic and even with a good prescription benefit it was costing me $60/month.','I have difficulties using prescription eyedrops because most contain a preservative called benzalkonium chloride that I&039;m allergic too - my eyes get red, irritated and burn. This eye drop does not have the preservative. It was a life saver for my conjunctivitis Within 2 days it started to clear up - the drops were easily tolerated.','I am on it now day 2 and the symptoms are subsiding... No side effects so far.','I started Saxenda on 2/19 weighing 247.6 lbs, 6 weeks later I&039;m at 228, 19.4 lbs gone. I lost the first 10 like in 2 weeks, then lost about 2.5 lbs a week after which is good to me I try to stay within 1200-1400 calorie daily intake and I have gone over that amount a couple of times. Side effects were minimal, mostly heartburn, especially if I eat late, so now I just don&039;t eat late, easy fix to that. I pay $30 per box with insurance and the Saxenda coupon, i would recommend this to anyone struggling to lose weight.','I have been using Loestrin since I gave birth to my 3rd child in August 2010. Before then I was using OrthoEvra, not my fave but I got free samples from my ObGyn so I wasn&039;t complaining. Let me just say this, I am horrible at remembering to take pills, and although I do miss taking them, A LOT, I can honestly say this has got to be a super birth control because there were times I&039;ve done things with my husband and I still havent gotten pregnant (crosses fingers) from forgetting to take the pill. At first, I experienced a little bloating and cramping, my periods were really heavy and lasted for 7 days for the 1st three months, but now they last 3 days and that&039;s it. I am definitely OK with that','18 months ago I was given prozac for depression and anxiety, which made me feel like a zombie, so the doctor changed to citalopram. I looked online and read that it would be very likely that I would feel worse before I feel better. I was given 20mg and felt terrible for about 3 weeks but knew I had to see it through as I had been on the verge of suicide previously. After about a month I suddenly felt like there was hope. This lasted a few weeks but then I felt the depression/ anxiety returning. Over the next couple of months my dosage was put up to 40 mg and this turned out to be the right dose for me.I specifically just waking up one day and feeling different, like my head was just free from worry and I was thinking happy thoughts.','I have had severe insomnia since my mom died in 2011. Sometimes I would be awake and watching Netflix for days. I was too sluggish to go out or even do work in my home. I couldn&039;t take one more sleepless night, and then my doctor gave me samples of Saphris. After the first pill and first night of sleep (falling asleep in about 10 minutes), I drove back and demanded a prescription and more samples. Its a VERY expensive medicine. However, my doctor had a coupon that offers 5 months for free ($13500/month value) and that&039;s 60 count 10mg tablets, and I only need one for sleep, so this is a great deal It has helped my mood as well, but having no insomnia saved my job. I give this medicine 10/10','I began taking 5 mg of lexapro 10 days ago, for postpartum depression/anxiety. It has been a lifesaver. The initial side effects faded within a week. I take it in the morning, because I knew that it would possibly make me jittery at first. I had tiredness in the afternoon and evening and a loss of appetite for the first 5 days, but those have faded completely. I searched and searched for positive reviews on this drug for postpartum depression/anxiety and could not find any. If anyone is on the fence about taking medication for postpartum depression, please consider it for a temporary aid in getting you past it.','I&039;ve taken this for well over a year now and I haven&039;t experienced any problems at all Light spotting in the first 3 months which is a side effect but then never again after that. My period is very regular and has began to lighten up drastically from what it use to be. No weight, skin, or mood changes. To those who it doesn&039;t work for, everyone reacts differently. For me it&039;s been awesome and I plan on staying with it','This medication definitely was effective in taking away the symptoms of urgency after I had a urinary procedure done. It worked pretty fast within 30min. However the side effect if &quot;fluttering heart&quot; was very negative for me as I have an anxiety disorder so the heart palpitations triggered me to get very panicky. The side effect starting after an hour of taking it and subsided about 2-3 hrs afterwards. Overall I would recommend this medication because the effectiveness was excellent.','This is my first time taking such a high dosage of this medicine, which was usual for me but I had abad tooth ache. I have taken penicillin before but at a lower dosage, however this new med has a higher dosage and the side effects are bothersome. I do not truly feel it is worth continuing to take. I&039;m consulting the doctor that prescribed the med to me from our local hospital&039;s ER.','Xanax got me through a year or so of acute anxiety and debilitating panic attacks. I got rather attached to those pretty lavender pills. I called them &quot;my darling little Easter eggs,&quot; they were so precious in relieving the terror that developed into agoraphobia. At max dose I was so sedated I started calling it &quot;Zombinal.&quot; It had stopped working its magic, and under the care of a naturopath I simply stopped taking it. Amazingly, after a couple of shaky days, my anxiety diminished and panic attacks were history. I later learned that between depleted receptors and mini-withdrawls, Xanax was actually causing my symptoms. No more Xanax, no more panic, not even the slightest anxiety. I guess I got cured.','I&039;ve been on Nexplanon for about 3-4 months now. After about two weeks I started bleeding pretty much non-stop for about a month. I&039;ve never had regular periods and they always been light or moderate with only minimal cramping. The month long bleeding I had was definitely light, but steady and a nuisance. However, now I hardly bleed at all. I said I don&039;t have any periods but occasionally I&039;ll have a couple days of light bleeding. I haven&039;t gotten pregnant, and have had no weight gain. I&039;m sorry to hear others experience has been less satisfactory but I would definitely recommend Nexplannon. I love that I don&039;t have to worry about getting pregnant or taking a pill regularly. If it matters, I&039;m 19.','I have been on the ring for 2 years, but I am now realizing that my mood swings, hair loss and zero sex drive is from this birth control. I was to put the ring in yesterday but I&039;m didn&039;t.  ','I have been on Contrave for a little over a month now and I have lost 7 pounds. Not gonna lie, I almost stopped taking it. The first 2 weeks I had severe stomach pains, each time lasting about 10 minutes, after the end of week 2, the pains stopped. I have no had the urge to drink coffee anymore, used to drink 3 cups a day. I am not eating as much, I used to eat a footlong sandwich from Subway, now I&039;m lucky if I finish half. This is not a medication for people looking for rapid results. I am taking it day by day and so far I am happy with my results.','For my periods, the first few days are usually absolutely unbearable. I would be hugging the toilet from the moment I woke up until I went to bed for almost 3 days straight. My mom, being a doctor, set me up with Zofran and seriously it is the most incredible pill I have ever taken. Within 10 minutes, my stomach has settled and I&039;m ready to take on the day.','I am taking 70 mg of Vyvanse and also taking Contrave (which contains Wellbutrin). I was feeling ok, but multiple tragedies kept me in a severe state of depression, anxiety and overwhelming sense of apathy. every day I wanted to die. The dr gave me some samples of this med to take with current meds, and last night was the first time I took it. I did feel nauseous, but my doc had told me to take it at night and with food, so that helped since I went to bed once I started feeling sick. I woke up with so much energy. I actually sprung out of bed ready to take on the day, and looked forward to it. I was shocked that it had such a fast effect, but so happy because it&039;s been a really long time since I&039;ve felt this good. Hoping it will last.','It made my breasts huge (well a half size or so bigger). I&039;ll take anything at this point. I&039;m less crazy hormonally.','I am a 20 year old college student and Nuvaring is the first hormonal birth control I&039;ve tried. It&039;s now the second month I&039;ve been using the ring and I am feeling great with no side effects If you are trying Nuvaring for the first time, there will be a lot of breakthrough bleeding the first month until your body adjusts to the hormones. After the first month the bleeding stopped and everything&039;s back to normal. I recommend this birth control for extremely busy women who want convenience and simplicity, and Nuvaring has both. This is great birth control, I would encourage any woman to try it','Don&039;t start this drug for sleep or anxiety It&039;s the most addicting drug on the face of this earth. It&039;s more addicting than heroin. I was given this drug and OMG it made everything so much better. Sleep, no anxiety then WHAM it quit working. I had to up the dose from .5 mg to 2 mg then when 2 mg was no longer working my psyche Rx me seraquel bc I couldn&039;t sleep. BIG mistake now I&039;m dependent on yet another drug that quit working last year ( after 10 years) now I&039;m on disability for IBS, IC and pelvic floor dysfunction bc I took these drugs. Oh did I add I had to be put on another drug to help sleep so I&039;m polydrugged. What I&039;d do to have my life back. Don&039;t ruin your life. Klonopin is poison ','Just plain awful tasting, and after all the pain and suffering, it did not clean me out well enough and so the doctor said I have to have the colonoscopy redone in six months','I has suffer from mild acne since 14yrs old. At age 19 I was diagnosed with Rosacea on top of the acne. I have tried EVERYTHING out there. So far, I am 30yrs old now, Accutane and Rhofade have had the best results for me. After my 3rd course of Accutane for 5 months, which makes my face look like porcelain, I started to break out again, my dermatologies gave me 2 little samples of Rhofade and with first application my face was clear again from redness &amp; what looks like ezcema. I have used it 2 days so far and it is wonderful. I do feel some sensation on my cheeks but it is worth it.','Have suffered from eczema all over face, neck, upper body. Nothing worked, and I had to moisturize every 15-30 mins throughout the day.  2 yrs ago, I stopped using topical steroids and had a serious rebound effect of worsening eczema.  Since then, it&039;s been manageable, but has never improved. I&039;ve tried changing my diet, going organic, different moisturizers, bleach baths, Bactroban, etc. It was hard to get the prescription as this is a product that not many Drs are familiar with. In 2 weeks, I almost finished the 90g tube, but my skin improved so much My face is baby-smooth. I could go for  8 hrs without moisturizer I finally have hope again. It still itches, but the skin quality has drastically improved. No side effects. And no more steroids','I&039;d been using Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo for about 6 years, but today I switched to a generic brand. I can only say negative about this - migraines, weight gain and tiredness. Not to mention the price. My insurance did not cover it so it cost about $50 a month. Hopefully my new pills will work out better for me.','Have now taken Harvoni for 32 days &amp; had some fatigue the 1st two weeks. Now I have no side effects at all.','For the past 3 years I have been dealing with nerve pain left from shingles in my neck. I have tried EVERYTHING for this pain including injections and narcotics. Nothing really helped unless I was a zombie. I am allergic to a lot of medications including Tegretol and Neurontin. So when my neurologist suggested I try this medication I was VERY skeptical. I have been on this medicaton for a week now. I started on 25mg twice a day and felt some relief. I thought it was in my head. Now I am on 50mg twice a day and I can&039;t believe the difference. I am relieved I can finally get my life back. I am a mother of 2. I did not realize how much the pain had taken over my life until now.','First of my symptoms was sensitive to light I can&039;t see have to wear Sun glasses in my house and outside saying that I can&039;t not drive long distance vision way to blurry and legs give out not safe anymore... I had a convulsion affter feeling not needing air my legs gave out on me and I blacked out I&039;ve had many other episodes where my vision goes blurry then I can&039;t see and my legs gave out needing assistance in getting to a couch I&039;m having trouble swallowing anything thinking chunky, I just went through esophagus xrays and testing they say it may be the medicine I can&039;t eat rarely eat in dehydrated but don&039;t wanna go back to Dr again.','I had a little burning was very minor I put the anti itch cream on the outside like I was instructed to do and I had no problem with itching any further....... I used the 3 day one and the second day I have absolutely no additional symptoms','I&039;ve been taking this for 7 days and I can feel it changes me.  I feel somewhat depressed, breakout and angry all the time I hate it need to change it for something else ugh again','I have been using Nuvigil for one week now.  It was working great in the beginning but after around the third day I got extremely tired around 12pm and all I wanted to do was take a nap.  I continue to take it thinking that this will change.  I only take 150mg, maybe I should ask the doctor to up the dose.','Hey ya&039;ll I wanted to share my experience since I looked at these religiously prior to going. I got Skyla yesterday around 2 o&039;clock. I took 800 mg of ibuprofen around 1:15, prior to my appointment. When I went in the entire experience was an absolute breeze. She walked in, told me the risks, set up, and inserted Skyla, all within 7 minutes. I felt a slight period type cramp when she used the sound to measure my uterus, and then a another cramp when she inserted Skyla. The cramp on both occasions did not last longer than thirty seconds. I felt absolutely fine after and even went out to dinner and to a professional baseball game Everyone is different but don&039;t worry too much - you&039;ll do great','At the first sign of a cold sore, I have taken 2 g of valacyclovir (once at first sign then again 12 hours later) and managed to prevent them from forming. As soon as I notice the tingle, I take it. Sometimes I get a little bit of a stomachache from it, but eating a moderate amount with it seems to prevent that. The mild stomachache is much more tolerable than cold sores though. Overall, I have been very happy with valacyclovir.','I started this med after I found out my husband had affair. I was lost, didn&039;t want to live. All I wanted to do was cry. Been on this medicine for around 3 months, 10 mg to start w/ now up to 20mg. This medicine has been a lifesaver for me. It has even helped save my marriage. I have Been the happiest I have been in awhile I really love this medication, I finally got myself out of the darker place I was in, the place I hope to never go back to. I&039;m feeling much stronger day by day. Still have a few moments where I think about what he did but I can deal with it, we deal with it. My depression is about completely gone, my work at my job has improved, I can socialize with others now with no problem. Life is looking better.','I tried this medicine for 2 months, I lost 9 lbs. It was hard falling asleep at night, most nights I couldn&039;t fall asleep until 4 or 5 am. It also made me feel depressed.','I was in a car accident with a head injury. I had intractable migraine and other headaches that came and went daily on top of that and three months after the accident my neurologist offered Topamax. It&039;s been 9 months. I lost a lot of hair; I have the soda is flat thing; the pins and needles; and I have lost weight. I think the brain fog was not noticable because of the brain injury. It took care of my headaches immediately. I didn&039;t mind the side effects. I ran out of it once and on day two had a seizure. I tried to titrate off recently and the migraine returned with a vengeance so I am still going to be taking it. I don&039;t mind the side effects in comparison to the headache. Also-I use hypnosis for some of the side effects.','I have had Implanon for two and a half years. The first three months were bliss: no period, no weight gain. Around four months I started to get acne, something I never had in high school and my periods came randomly. Some months I bled for 3 weeks on and off. Other months I would have 2 four day periods about a week apart. I never knew when I would start or stop. At two years I decided the irregular periods were too much and went to my gynecologist. She prescribed me low doses of estrogen. Since starting the estrogen my period have become more regular. All in all Implanon has done it&039;s job; I am not and have never been pregnant, and the side effects are worth being kid-free for three years.','I just started taking this medication 30mgs at bed time and it works great, but I also take 2mgs of Xanax in the morning and 2mgs at night so it really works well.','I&039;ve tried the others that dry your eyes and mouth, blurr your vision and even paralyze your muscles so that you can&039;t urinate without concentrating on it. This one is the winner. It cuts incontinence and overactive bladder with no side effects. I love it.','I got my Kyleena put in March 15th. The insertion was very uncomfortable but quick. I have only had very light spotting off and on since I had it placed. I have had a lot of cramping. I just hope that this birth control gets rid of my heavy periods and clots.','My Migraine headache starts with what they call Aura, which is blind spots in eyesight (eyesight will be blurry when this happens) and followed by the worst headache ever. From my experience, the Excedrin Migraine doesn&039;t work when you take it after the headache starts. But when you take it in early stage (which is for me, immediately after experiencing Aura), its very effective. Don&039;t expect you will be relieved from pain 100 percent, but at least it helps relieving 70 percent of pain. I would highly recommend to take it in very early stage when the migraine starts.','helped a little but still have a problem with urgency','I&039;ve had it since my 2 week exam afterI  had my baby on May 24,2017. A week after insertion I started heavy bleeding. Two weeks later I&039;m still bleeding I call my Dr. and nurse tells me I should have done research I&039;m so upset with myself. She told me I could bleed for up to SIX months STRAIGHT I wish Dr. would have said this to me I want it out. My husband  and I are ready to mess around too and we aren&039;t the type to do anything if I&039;m bleeding so yea, its gonna be a problem if I&039;m like this for so long. I DO NOT recommend it. ','Nuvigil was a blessing when I started it 18 months ago.  I was alert and focused, not depressed, AND retained my creativity  I think I&039;ve become dependent upon it since I feel awful without it.  This week the doctor wants me to try going to 250mg since I&039;ve been a bit down with shorter days and less focused.  Due to cardiac conditions, amphetamines are not really a safe option.  All said, at age 51, it&039;s been pretty much a wonder drug treating multiple conditions.','This is my first time to use BC and I knew the patch was the only thing for me (cannot remember to take pills)....  This is my second month and I&039;ve noticed my boobs are staying sore, I&039;m like crazy emotional and I&039;m so sleepy....  But no weight gain, no acne breakouts, no red bumps, no nausea..... I was told it could take 3 months to get in your system and I&039;m hoping that all this will go away next month.... The only thing that worries me is that I have no energy....  Is this a side effect????','I have been taking this pill for about 6 months, to prevent pregnancy. I&039;ve had regularly light periods and my appetite has drastically decreased, but I haven&039;t been losing weight. It slowed my sex drive down in the first few months of use, but my drive is back to normal now. I am also very moody, lethargic, and constipated. However, I like it since it is preventing me from getting pregnant and it&039;s free.','Took for the twelve weeks and was cleared of virus that I have had for almost 20 years. My viral load was in the 2 million range and no side effects at all. It has been 4 months now and still clear. My Doctor chose this treatment over others because I was treated in the early years with the interferon/ ribarvarin, and  it did not work for me.','Took Cipro for a sinus infection.  Six days in I couldn&039;t rotate my forearms. 3 years later, numerous doctors, two surgeries and my arms are practically useless.  FDA black box warning on it people. Google the drug. Do not ever take, fluoroquinolones are poison. They were originally developed to give to soldiers exposed to Anthrax.  And try to never take generic.  US Supreme Court says if you do you are not allowed to sue the original drug manufacturer OR the generic company you used. This drug ruined my life.','OK DONT FREAK OUT Bc if you&039;re reading these reviews you&039;re probably freaking out hoping there&039;s a way out of the stupid decision you made to have unprotected sex OR begging god for mercy bc your condom broke Well this stuff works I had protected sex and at he ended, the condom snapped OH NO I&039;m very fertile I have a little already...so the very next morning I drove to Walmart and bought it. Took it asap and now exactly 6 days later I GOT MY PERIOD A week early thank you thank you','On Ampyra for over a year with no real benefit.','Tried everything before Botox. This was miraculous','wow the side effects I have never experienced acne like this before....I seriously break out all the time and I&039;m 31 years old I wanted the 5 year plan but I&039;m breaking out like I remember 7th grade','I used Apri for 2 yrs but with a gap of a few months in between. When I got on it the second time my symptoms were different than the first time. For the first month I was always nauseous or on the verge of throwing up within literally 30min-1hr of taking the pill [I learned that eating right after helped a lot] But I decided to give it a go until the second month. After that first month I was fine. I did go through a few months of increased appetite but thank goodness I didn&039;t gain weight some how. Periods are not as painful, long or heavy. My minor acne decreased. my hair is longer and stronger then its ever been. My chest did get bigger now that I think about it. Overall I like Apri especially since it only cost me $9.','Works pretty well as birth control but I take it mainly for period regulation. It does well with that too. I don&039;t mind the weight gain or the fact that I am constantly eating/snacking since I&039;m pretty active and my metabolism surprisingly keeps up w/my cravings. the most interesting thing I noticed was actually an increase in my sex drive. usually the opposite right? But this stuff makes me want to do it all the time I stopped it for a month because it was making me way too emotional, I would cry literally every morning at work. But then I noticed a decrease in sexual desire and extreme difficulty getting an orgasm (w my boyfriend AND by myself). needless to say I went right back to taking them. small price to pay for an amazing sex-life.','I want to throw a ticker tape parade for the manufacturers of this medicine. It changed my life. I&039;m 13 weeks and was flat on my back gagging all day every day. I tried all the tricks and nothing worked until I tried this. I am back in the land of the living and hoping to regain the 10 lbs I lost in the 1st trimester.  I did A LOT of research and there is nothing that indicates that this medicine causes any problems whatsoever for baby. It is probably the best researched medicine on the market to date. Emily Oster&039;s book Expecting Better has a nice explanation for why it was pulled in the US (but not UK or Canada) for 30 yrs.','Great product. Company paid the co-pay too.  ','If you haven&039;t taken Estarylla before, I&039;d recommend giving it a try. I&039;ve had pretty much no negative side effects other than a mild nausea after the first few pills in a new pack, and it&039;s helped a lot with my acne. My periods are also significantly shorter and less severe than they were with no medication/other birth control. Looking at other reviews, this definitely doesn&039;t work well for some people, but its been really effective for me.','I&039;ve been on gabapentin for several yrs &amp; it was originally for back pain. I had my L4/5 disc fused then 6 years later had a spinal cord stimulator put in. 4 surgeries later NO RELIEF AT ALL. I&039;ve been on 300 MG 3x&039;s a day. But recently my neurologyst decided that I should actually take 600 MG 3x&039;s a day because I&039;ve been suffering from migraines since age 7. The thing that I&039;ve noticed is that my memory is off. I will be in a drive thru &amp; have a list of items that I want off the menu &amp; as soon as they ask me what I want, I draw a blank &amp; look at my son like &quot;HELP&quot; At first I didn&039;t think anything of it but now it&039;s becoming habit. Why??','Given Prevpac for H. Pylori. Within 48 hrs of ending the full course of medication I experienced an anaphylactic reaction. Large, round, flat hives formed on the soft of my arms and inner thighs. My hands began to swell, and then I felt my face begin to swell. The swelling moved from left to right across my face, and it eventually began to close my throat and enlarge my tongue. My husband drove me to an urgent care center where I received a shot of Kenalog and a Medrol dose pack. I always list Prevpac as a medicine of which I am allergic.','I take this medicine for weight loss only. I am not a diabetic...lost about 20lbs in about four months. The first month saw the most weight loss. I now lose about 4-6 lbs a month. I am happy that I am still losing weight...the only side effect I have had is a random headache but that started when I upped my dosage to 1.8. Yes, the medicine came with some side effects, all drugs do...but you need to take it so see what side effects you may have since everybody is difference. Then you need to out weigh the pros and cons. For me I will put up with the random headache to keep losing the weight.','I had this drug given to me when I was hit by a car as I walked across the street.  I couldn&rsquo;t take meds I was given due to side effects.  My pain was so severe I was given a shot of Toradol. What relief  It worked extremely well for me.  Four years later I had sciatic nerve pain.  I asked my doctor for a shot of Toradol.  After three days and nights of extreme pain and discomfort, the Toradol shot took it all away. I am so relieved.  No side effects- just good old pain relief','I just got it today 4/27/17 and the pain is unbearable. My fiance held me the second time after my doctor took it out because I was in tears the first time. I have a 0 pain tolerance. Took 1600mg (2 800mg morning and afternoon) of ibuprofen it does help but so does a heating pad. If anyone has advice for skyla please let me know.','I was addicted to oxys in Anchorage for 3 years, buying them off the street.  I dropped out of college, lost several jobs, and hurt every person I cared for just to get high.  I moved away hoping to get away from the drugs, and just ended up at a methadone clinic for another 3 years.  I finally made the choice to start suboxone, it&039;s only been a week but I feel a hundred times better.','I just started using this and find it really works.','Bupropion is a miracle I still had some cravings, a little irritability, a few depressing nightmares- but I quit I smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for a decade. I have not had a cigarette in over a month, and live with people that smoke in the house. No patches, no gimmicks, just plugging through it with bupropion. I would recommend giving this a go to anyone.','I started having graphic, vivid nightmares and wasn&039;t able to tell the difference between being awake and asleep.   The doctor told me I had PTSD and gave me Prazosin. I was taking 1mg.     I&039;m pretty drug sensitive so I could barely move or get up for hours after waking up the next day BUT it immediately stopped my nightmares. Now when I do have nightmares I don&039;t react to them and I take .5mg as needed when I am feeling anxious. I get a little weak for a few hours but it&039;s manageable.     Side effects are totally worth it to not have to live through being terrorized every night not even knowing when I&039;m awake or alseep.','I switched to this birth control from Gildess fe 1/20 (It made me depressed intensified my anxiety and I was having two periods a month). At first I was skeptical from initial water retention and moodiness but after the first month was over all those initial issues disappeared.','I have been battling a C diff infection for a couple months now.  I tried a 10 day (500mg x3) course of Flagyl which didn&039;t seem to help much. The Flagyl seemed to increase my nausea while only slightly reducing the waves of stomach pain and didn&039;t seem to improve the diarrhea much at all. A couple days after ending the Flagyl, I was experiencing the worst symptoms of C diff.  I immediately went on Vancomycin.  I just finished a 14 day course (500mgx4) of Vancomycin yesterday, which seems to have cleared up the symptoms.  Vancomycin is extremely expensive (my portion was nearly $2k after insurance picked up the bulk of the cost), but after Flagyl failed, I was glad the Vancomycin seems to have worked with no noticeable side effects.','This medication really works for me, I wouldn&039;t know what I would do without it. However, it does upset my stomach a bit.','I just started using Fastin and I like it better than other diet pills I&039;ve tried such as Hydroxycut because it doesn&039;t make me feel sick/ nauseous. BUT it definitely makes my heart rate skyrocket, so for the first couple days I would only take half a pill at a time. A full pill makes my hands tremble and I can hear my pulse in my brain.','Works so well I forget I have a problem until I forget to take it, then I&039;m reminded the next day...ugh','Fantastic No bloating or weight gain Yippee Hot flashes are gone, helped the first week, would have a few here and their but they were mild and by the second month- they are totally gone and sleeping so much better- the feeling of anxiety is gone- life grand again   Immmmmm soooo happy','Ok sooo I started taking Belviq on July 11,2015. I took 1 pill at 9a I started feeling like I was intoxicated, dizzy &amp; very tired for like a 1/2 an hour. Then my  muscles began to feel alil achy  in both arms,my cheeks on my  face started feeling achy like I had been smiling for 2hrs &amp;lil lower back pain. It all was just  alil discomfort nothing too  alarming that I needed any  pain meds for. After a couple    hours it had passed &amp; so did my appetite. Once I noticed the  time it was 7p so I made                 myself eat a salad &amp; took the 2nd pill. I didnt like the 2nd dosage because it made me feel dizzy &amp; like I just came from a bar. So I only take 1am pill a day. July 11-July18 288lb to 282lb 7 days lost 6lbs &amp; feeln good.','I personally like these birth control pills. I have only been on them for a month but I used to get horrible period pains where I had to stay home from school, couldn&039;t eat or keep down anything, and had to lay in bed and now with these pills I am getting my period very light with little to no pain. It is a relief I did get some migraines and sore chest but I got those when I wasn&039;t on the pill as well. I would recommend birth control if you are having such bad cramps because it really helped me.','Well, I took it for the first time on a Thursday, felt an erection like old days after seeing a hottie. I&039;ve been getting about 90\% hard prior to Cialis. By Friday, I was going all night. And again Saturday and Sunday morning. It is awesome. My Dr said it might be mental anyway. And the Cialis might just be enough to get me back on track.','Helped with my insomnia 100\% until they pulled it off the market. Many thanks to the manufacturer I had used this medicine for such a long time. I never could sleep before taking this and I still now watch the time go by.  ','I have been using Aleve for about 6 months.  This medicine helps relieve all my aches and pains.  I&039;m 68 and working in food industry.  Although I experience severe body and joint pains on a daily basis I take one Aleve on the days I work and can put in 4 to 6 hours pain free.  I have not suffered any side effects so far.  So far none of the other medicines I have tried have been as effective as Aleve.','Has anyone gained weight on this','My doctor switched me from Asacol (which was working very well) to Lialda and the results were horrible.  When I started having bad flare ups my gastroenterologist had no clue what do do.  She put me on Remicade over 16 months with no results and I was miserable.  When I suggested that perhaps it was the Lialda that was causing the problems she stated that that was &quot;not likely&quot;.  Well, after about two years of misery and being back on steroids, I switched doctors - a guy who came highly recommended. After a heart to heart consultation with him, he stated he had some patients who did not do well with Lialda and decided to take me off that medication immediately. Within three weeks I was off steroids, back to using Asacol and life is now okay.','I have been on diclofenac 75mg twice a day for 5 years.  The first year I took it 2 X each day.  After the methotrexate began to kick in, I now only take it when needed when I get a flare up.  At the most, only about once per week, sometimes less.  It has made a big difference in helping me manage the pain of rheumatoid arthritis.','Personally, thus drug gives me a fixed drug eruption in the form of a huge, round rash on one of my breasts that is intensively itchy and burns. It feels like a horrible sunburn. Therefore, I am clearly not a fan.','Prozac really worked for me. It kept my depression under control along with my anxiety. Only side affects is you can forget about sex I also experienced short term memory loss.','This Migraine Med is a must have if you expereince regular Migraines..no side effects','I absolutely loved Pristiq - great energy - great sex - felt good. I unfortunately suffered a side effect that I couldn&039;t empty my bladder all the way. So that meant sleep deprivation. My MD thought it was a UTI, but getting off the medicine and seeing a urologist cleared up the symptoms. The urologist said it was a very common side effect of Pristiq. He put me on Flomax for a couple of weeks... Loved Pristiq, hate that I can&039;t take it.','This is a terrible pill and I wouldn&039;t recommend anybody to start this med unless you are ready for the bad side effects of coming off of this med when it doesn&039;t work . This med cause me to lose about 3 years of memory lose and almost my marriage.','Took my first dose 2 hours ago. I smelled it and thought to myself &quot;this won&039;t be too bad.. It smells like cough syrup&quot; Well, two sips in I was gagging like no other. It took about a half hour to choke it down. Instantly, cramps and the worst nausea I&039;ve ever experienced. Slowly a headache added to my problems and I&039;ve been miserable since. First movement just happened and yeah, faucet-butt that won&039;t shut off It definitely works. But I&039;m scared that I won&039;t be able to get my second dose down.','19 years old. I experienced acne since 12 on chest, face, neck, and extending to my entire back.

First month: Fatigue','I have been on Belviq for about 1.5 years - I initially started taking it to lose weight before my wedding last year. From the time I began taking Belviq (August 2015), I started feeling results - although slow - within about a month.  I had several fittings and such before the big day and the seamstress had to keep taking my dress in. I had lost about 20 lbs in ~4 months  I was amazed    So here we are two months after my wedding anniversary, and I am currently down ~75lbs.  I started at about 245 - and the last time I weighed myself I was at 170.  I have gone from a size 18/20 to a size 12. I would still like to lose another ~20 lbs, and I have no doubt I&039;ll get there with Belviq.','The medicine worked right off the bat, after 30 minutes or so, could breathe much better, and as a smoker, helped my wheezing go away, and not as tired with more energy. NOW the BAD part. I have had a heart attack and have 3 stents. For 3 years, my bp has been perfect at 110/65 with a pulse of 58 to 65 even drinking caffiene and smoking. Since starting this, BP has increased a little, but pulse no matter what stays above 110 24/7, SO, can&039;t take it for that reason only...','It works well for depression.  Even stopped nerve pain that I didn&039;t know I had since I had lived with it all my life.  I just thought it was normal to have pins and needle feeling in my nerve endings.  Lifted the depression.  Was okay on anxiety, but still had to take Valium for true panic attacks.  Warning though - getting off this medication can give hard withdrawals. You have to slowly wean yourself off. If not, you will get brain freezes or shivers which are freaky and scary.  Also, extremely irritable coming off of it.','Works great for strep infection.','Severe leg pain , cramping in legs and feet, bruising.

Thank you, Boniva','I&039;ve had terrible motion sickness, and nothing has worked until I used this medication. It worked PERFECT the first few times. I took it everytime I traveled in a plane. However, I&039;ve noticed the more I use the patch, the worse the side effects have become. After using the patch, I now experience extremely dry throat/eyes/nose, blurred vision, and even nausea. Although it has successfully kept me from becoming sick while traveling up until this point, I&039;m not sure if this effect will always hold true.','My son has IGA deficiency and as soon as he stopped taking this medication his fever returned.','2nd time in 14 month my daughter has lice. Used rid. Day 2 small live lice appeared. Possibly hatched overnight. Called pediatrician and day 2 got a script for Sklice. With coupon &amp; insurance, paid $10. I was so hopeful this was the answer to our prayers. My daughter has very long hair &amp; takes hours to nit pick. I even use a magnifier lamp light to check her head which I highly recommend Sklice is supposed to kill nits. My older daughter has a microscope &amp;did a little science experiment:out of about 15 nits, 6 were still alive. I have checked her hair daily for 7 days since using Sklice and vacuumed &amp; laundered everything (more than once) &amp; day 7 found a live louse on her head Retreated with rid and cleaned again Disappointed w/sklice.','New to IUD, never had kids. Easy insertion, NO cramping, NO heavy flow -- I wish I&039;d gotten a ParaGard IUD sooner','Like most people on here, I have super bad public speaking anxiety.  I&039;ll freak out months, weeks, days before and essentially just shut down when I have to get up and talk. In the past, I&039;ve had terrible voice shaking, felt my body go weak and no longer able to stand, my eyes go fuzzy and I can&039;t see anything. I&039;ve only used this for one group presentation so far, but it was actually amazing what it did for me.

On day 4 I began with severe itching, burning, and hives and returned to the doctor. This antibiotic also seemed to have little affect on my original illness. I am now on a Z pack and feel much better. Now I have to be on a long course of Prednisone for my allergic reaction which has yet to subside. This by far has been the worst antibiotic I have ever taken in my life. Never ever again','It saved my life and lives of others I came in contact with at times.','26 years old with previously regular periods, lasting 5 days. Cramped, but normal. I dealt with cystic acne during my cycle.  I had sklya inserted  April 2015, so 6 month now. It was extremely painful. The cramps/pain/bleeding did not stop. It would come on suddenly/severely that it totally had me hit the floor in agony. MRI showed a cyst burst; I never had cysts prior to this. I continued to have horrible cramping/spotting throughout the months and especially during my period. Cystic acne increased to a level I have never experienced before. 6 months later, still horrible acne, period last @2 wks,with bad cramping, 2 weeks in between, and then the period begins again. It is coming out I waiting the 6 months, but this is not acceptable.','I was diagnosed back in 2011. I am 22 years old, about to start college and found out that I had psudotumor cerebri, it took the doctors 3 days and 2 nights to figure out what was wrong with me, I went on toprimate, diamox, and for the migraines I was also on Fioricet. I have been through many, many doctors. Moved down to KY with my family in 2013, been here for two years. I have learned to live with the pain and the headaches, I finally was able to find neurologist, and he put me on diamox. I have lost 8 IBS being on it already, tingling in the fingers, and around my lips. I no longer drink pop anymore at all, it works.','I have had a perfect check up, for four years in a row, using Clinpro toothpaste. It has saved me alot of money, &amp; improved my gums. I am very satisfied with this product. I would recommend everyone to invest in it. My Dentist is one of the top 500 Dentists in America, located in Fort Smith, Arkansas, who recommended me to start using this great product. I have all the faith in my Dentist. Just brush with Clinpro, floss daily, &amp; have regular check ups, and I believe you will be happy as I am with this toothpaste. It has more fluoride &amp; calcium than any toothpaste over the counter. I encourage everyone to try this toothpaste.','I&039;ve been on this birth control for six months and I love it. I had acne all over my back and very few on my face. Within the first month my face cleared up and some on my back. Im now going on my seventh month and my whole back is clear. Ladies with acne definitely need to try this and Give it time to work','I had it implanted in October of 2013. I didn&039;t have a period at all for the first year and then the week of the one year mark I got one. Totally normal about 5 days just like my periods before getting pregnant. From then (oct 2014 to now June of 2015 I&039;ve had a period about every 3-4 months. They are totally normal or very light. That part has been GREAT The negative side effects I&039;ve seen have been some break outs on my face, mild mood swings and irritability. But it hasn&039;t ever gotten bad enough to make me want to get it removed. I have sex regularly and it has done its job. No babies. And I also started losing weight after being on it. I would say this is a great choice if you don&039;t wanna worry about taking a pill every day','I have lost 26lbs during the past six months. I didn&039;t work out consistently, I am going to to continue to take it as I still have more I want to lose.','This medication has pretty much saved my sanity. Got diagnosed with migraine 2 years ago after having one so bad doctor thought I was having a stroke. Started off getting migraines at 4 or 5 a month but am now up to 9 in a 13 day period so am being investigated for triggers etc but zolmitriptan has been amazing every time. Guess I&039;m the lucky one not getting side effects per se but I already suffer from CFS/ME so wouldn&039;t notice extra fatigue anyway. I get this on a UK prescription at 12 tablets each time so maybe &pound;UK18.00 per month.','Overall experience is ok. My mix: refrigerated suprep, slightly chilled water, ginger ale. Drink as fast as you can.  After gulping down as much as you can simply suck on a lemon to get rid of the taste.  Continue process and it&039;ll be over quickly.  The second bottle in the morning is tougher.  Might be because your stomach is not expanded and chugging the solution plus two more 16oz bottles of water is really filling.  It started working for me 20min after drinking.  Be sure to get wet wipes.  BTW there&039;s no pain with the bathroom part of it, not like an upset stomach, it takes surprisingly little effort for the bowel movement.  Good luck','My doctor prescribed Lopid after my triglyceride levels were out of control.  I feel great  No side effects and with Lopid and fish oil they are much better.  From 1900 a year ago to 160.','I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS DRUG I like many of you really from what I have read had a great experience AT FIRST. I am 26 years old and do sales for a living. I was on cloud nine towards the beginning trail of this prescription. I was able to concentrate more than I had in months and was more motivated to go out and look for new leads for my company. I found that I would get dizzy or a tab nauseous but I found that staying hydrated and always having a water bottle with me helped out. I developed a problem where I would know what I wanted to say but when I went to speak it didn&039;t come out right and literally made me sound like I was high or drunk. VERY SCARY','A smoker for 30 years and decided to try Champix after several failed atempts at quiting, three days into course I hated the taste of smoking. That was 14 months ago, take Champix with food to stop the sicky feeling, don&039;t give up give them a chance, they work.','Took the Plan B pill 1 hour after intercourse. I took it on an empty stomach, which you should NOT do. I felt crazy symptoms for about 1 month. It felt as if I were pregnant. I have been nauseous, tired, mood swings. Horrible feeling, and it lasted quite a while. 1 week after I had taken the pill, I got some spotting that lasted 3 days. I took 7 home pregnancy tests (all negative) because of all the worry. But I just received my period today, which I am so happy about. ','I got my Implanon inserted on June 30th of this year, on the last day of my period.  I may have spotted for 2 days after about 15 days of having it.  However, it is now October 20th and I have not gotten my period yet, no bleeding or nothing, and I am not pregnant.  I may have gained about 5 pounds, but I won&039;t blame the Implanon, I have been bad with my eating habits.  I have not gotten acne, or cramps, or moods or anything, although I may have a little headache once in a while, but nothing else.','I have tried all methods if birth control except the shot and nothing was right for me. I always experienced headaches, terrible mood swings, nausea, weight gain and actually forgetting (the pill). I heard about the IUD, but was so afraid to give it a try because of all of the horrible reviews that I have read. After realizing that everyone is different, and not remembering to take the pill daily I thought what the heck. I spoke to my doctor and I had the Mirena inserted yesterday. Although it was very uncomfortable, not as painful as some of the postings. I did feel a pinch and cramped slightly, but the process was not that day. Today (day 2) I am cramping, but nothing that a few ibuprofen couldn&039;t handle. I am spotting and have on a pantyliner.','Tried ambien  but it lost it effect around 10 months. Lunesta tasted like I sucked on a roll of pennies all night. Trazodone just wasn&039;t really effective. I take 30mg of restoril about 20 mins before I need to be in bed. Otherwise I&039;ve awaken in different parts of house. I also take a .75mg give or take .25mg of Xanax as a kicker. I would have problems staying asleep. Sometimes no more sleep that night sometimes the crappy toss n turn sleep till you get mad n get up. Then drag ass all day. Occasionally I still get one of those nights but they are once in a long while. It works for me and I recommend (but does not for a friend) If you&039;ve tried the others give it a try it&039;s cheap nothing to loose.','Its been 5 months since I got the implant and I have already gained more than 15 pounds. The first 2 months was constantly having headache which I never had before and soreness in my breast. I have mood swings. Sometimes I snap for no reason. Definitely easily irritated.  My sex libido also decreased.  The only good thing about this birth control is that you don&039;t get your period anymore. A little spotting but not bleeding. I&039;m taking it out for sure.','Cataflam is a life saver but it takes about an hour after swallowing to start working. I take 2 at a 6 hr interval and can take up to six at the end of the day, but that&039;s only for the first day of the period. ','I was on microgestin 1.5 for almost a year but hated the way it made me feel bloated and uncomfortable all the time. I take birth control to help with my horrible cramps that leave me bed ridden if not controlled. My Dr. Switched me to triNessna and at first it was great. No side effects...no bloating...slight change in my sex drive. But it didn&039;t help with the cramps...as a matter of fact I would cramp longer during my period on it than I would without it. I thought since I had just stared it I would give it some time. I&039;ve been on it for 6 months now and I have been bleeding/spotting on and off throughout the day for 4 days now and I&039;m in the middle of the pack. I&039;m making him switch to something else.','I have been on this birth control for 3 months now. Since starting I have been nothing but sick. Every time I eat I&039;ve been sick afterwards. I haven&039;t gained weight, my breasts have increased in size but are tender. I stopped taking it. ','I will make 3 years of being on Skyla April 2018. So far I have had a miserable experience on Skyla. When I first got it inserted I cramped and bleed for 2 months straight. I went back in for checkups during those two months and the doctor said it was normal. And that my body was just adjusting. The bleeding stopped after the 3rd month, but started back immediately after having sex.  And from that point on it was a constant cycle or stopping, sex, bleeding back on. I would say out of an entire month I only had like 10 days (if that) of not bleeding. My cycles were not heavy, and I didn&039;t really experience any cramps, but bleeding constantly gets to be annoying. I would probably not get a new one inserted after my 3 years is over.','I started taking Aviane because of horrible PMS while on Mircette and did the three month continuous route. It kind of helped alleviate PMS but for some reason my body wouldn&039;t listen to the pill and continued to have a monthly period well into the second three month span along with spotting. The breaking point was when I had a total PMS episode complete with migraine and heavy period about a month and a half into the second three months. I am switching to Yaz, and hoping things improve','Taking the slow release, 120 mg version.  I take it at night about 30 minutes before bedtime.  Averts any dizziness since I am going to bed to sleep.  BP has been good 125/80 generally. resting pulse of about 60.  Thankfully I am optimal weight and I exercise 4 to 5 times weekly, mostly a 2 mile walk each time and about 50 situps.   Drinking lots of water to stay hydrated. mild constipation so I eat a cup of yogurt at least every other day.','I have been taking Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo for about five weeks now. I had some back pain the first week. When my period came it was very heavy and lasted longer. Now in week five I am having terrible low back pains, slight nausea and I&039;m a bit emotional at night...not sure if I should wait for the hormones to balance out in the next couple of months or talk to the doctor about other options?','I was on Skyla for about 2 years and had an okay experience. The pros- insertion and removal were quick and easy, just a pinch. I had some cramping following both but in both cases it didn&039;t last longer than a day. Not having to worry about taking the pill. This was the entire reason I got on. It was nice not to worry about it.  The cons- Irregular bleeding. Some months I had the heaviest flow which would last 10 days and others I had light sporting for 2 days. It was very frustrating to be inconsistent. Also, body acne. I started breaking out on my back, shoulders, chest, and neck all places I had never had before. Anxiousness during sex, I know the Dr says it can&039;t be moved, but I felt pain/fear when a partner went too deep. Hope I helped','I had to stop taking Zelapar because I was having an operation. After a couple of days the operation was postponed and I forgot that I had stopped taking Zelapar. Anyway mid-day one afternoon I was having a horrible time because it seemed all movement had stopped, the next day the same, a couple of more days went by and I figured my good luck was up and it was time for either new medicines or a D.B.S. Then I remembered that I was not taking the Zelapar, well I went back to my daily dose and I am almost my old moving self. Thanks.','I&039;ve been on this pill about 8 months now. It&039;s my 3rd birth control. Tricyclics give me bad migraines and I was on minastrin before this. Minastrin always made me really sad for no reason, too nauseous to eat, very moody and depressed and had no period. Cryselle was such a big turnaround for me. I&039;m back to my normal happy self, periods only last 1-2 days rarely any cramping. Only thing I noticed was a little bit of weight gain but that could also be from switching as the last birth control made me too sick to eat half the time.','Works within 2 hours but my migraine always returns the next day. I take the medication the next day - headache goes away within two hours - comes back the next day again.  Medication works but I feel extremely tired and depressed for the three days. Insurance companies also limit me to 9 pills a month which adds to my stress.'}

I take birth control to help with my horrible cramps that leave me bed ridden if not controlled. My Dr. Switched me to triNessna and at first it was great. No side effects...no bloating...slight change in my sex drive. But it didn&039;t help with the cramps...as a matter of fact I would cramp longer during my period on it than I would without it. I thought since I had just stared it I would give it some time.

1492,skyla,'birth control','I will make 3 years of being on Skyla April 2018. So far I have had a miserable experience on Skyla. When I first got it inserted I cramped and bleed for 2 months straight. I went back in for checkups during those two months and the doctor said it was normal. And that my body was just adjusting. The bleeding stopped after the 3rd month, but started back immediately after having sex.  And from that point on it was a constant cycle or stopping, sex, bleeding back on. I would say out of an entire month I only had like 10 days (if that) of not bleeding. My cycles were not heavy, and I didn&039;t really experience any cramps, but bleeding constantly gets to be annoying. I would probably not get a new one inserted after my 3 years is over.',0.444444,0.029197,0.328704,1,0.545455,0.8,0.5,0,cluster1

The breaking point was when I had a total PMS episode complete with migraine and heavy period about a month and a half into the second three months.

Cryselle was such a big turnaround for me. I&039;m back to my normal happy self, periods only last 1-2 days rarely any cramping.
